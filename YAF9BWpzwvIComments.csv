Like am I the only one that notices how much better certain apps are for iOS than for Android? Like even Youtube. Fucking Youtube, an app from Google. It looks and feels WAY better and faster and polished on iOS. Jesus. Spotify, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, EVERYTHING. Whenever I try to use an Android for a few months, I just fall back because I CANT STAND how ugly, slow and buggy Android apps are.\n\n\u201cYeah but Android isn\u2019t ugly anymore since material design, what about material design??\u201d\nMaterial Design has FAILED. Completeley. Developers don\u2019t use it, they just do their own design rules and styles that don\u2019t even come close to what material design was supposed to be. Even GOOGLE now introduced \u201cMaTeRIaL deSIgN 2\u201d that had NOTHING TO FUCKING DO with \u201cMaterial\u201d design anymore! It just looks completely different, like they just wanted to emulate iOS a little bit (for example the whitespaces and the clean animations).\n\nThen there\u2019s the thing I can\u2019t stand with for example Samsung phones, where\nyou have like 2 clock apps, 3 email apps, 2 music apps, 4 note apps, 3 gallery and 2 calendars. And a lot of other non-useful trash you can\u2019t delete. No thanks.\n\nSo that\u2019s that. Don\u2019t comment negatively if you\u2019ve never used an iOS device as daily driver. Because believe me: When you actually try one, you\u2019ll immediately feel how much more beautiful designed and smoother it is than your Pixel, Oneplus or Galaxy S.\n\np.s. I\u2019ve used a Google Pixel (1st), a Galaxy S8 and a Nexus 6 as daily driver. So yes, I know what Android and it\u2019s apps feel like."""

Although being ripped off could be subjective, particularly if you don\u2019t use many of the product features.\n\nI switched to Apple when the iPhone 4 was released, since then I\u2019ve had fairly regular upgrades. Each year the new product took the price of last years product, with the old one being knocked down in price until phased out. That was until the iPhone X was released. I\u2019m baffled at how the iPhone X gives Apple the leverage to charge so much more? It\u2019s a new year, new tech, and should be about the same price as the previous years flagship. \n\nI think it was a test. A test to see how much consumers were willing to pay for a new design. Remember, the iPhone 4 was a brand new design over the 3GS, but the price wasn\u2019t inflated by 50% (or so).\n\n512gb in a phone is quite extreme, particularly with the advent of cloud storage. But, \u00a31449 for a phone with this amount of storage is almost the same price as a current line MacBook. That\u2019s just plain crazy. \n\nWhat it has done, though, is pave the way for hugely inflated iPad prices due any day now. Again, there\u2019s no reason for a price hike based on my analogy above, it\u2019s a new year, new products, old flagship prices should remain. But they won\u2019t, you mark my words.\n\nThose \u2018complaining\u2019 and being told \u2018well don\u2019t buy them then\u2019 are missing the point. The people now complaining are the ones who love Apple products, the ones who have spent thousands upon thousands over the years who are now being thanked by these ridiculous prices. \u00a31449 for a phone. Just repeat that back to yourself. \n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus, which incidentally is the one I use and won\u2019t be upgrading again for quite some time, is kind of old for 2018. It\u2019s price should reflect that, with the X and XS/XS Max taking its place at similar prices to the 8.\n\nIt took days for Apple to run out of stock of the new phones for 2018 after release. Days. It used to take just hours, if that.\n\nSo yeah, I agree with the complaints, and so should you. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re part of the reason for yearly price increases to come. We all know Apple\u2019s pricing is premium, but not this year, this year they\u2019re taking the p**s out of you."""

Whoever doesn't know LCD = Liquid Crystal Display... and Xr has only 1 camera.\n\nAnyways, for the Xs and X... ss. Max (dang what kind of name is that?) what is the difference between those 2 and the X. I mean like 98.75% of the features are already in the X. Why don't they put both Touch ID and the Face-ID together for $1100? Why do they have to put away Fast charging since iPhone X? Why are they lying about the battery? What does it even mean 2x, 3x times better if you can't even show the test bench to anyone? About cameras, iPhone 7 was the first to have a dual camera, 12MP wide-angle and telephoto, and to say the truth... 3 generations with the 7P, 8P, X there has been no change in the camera for the Xs Max, the storage is too much for an average consumer then what's the point to raise the price. Is it because of your \""Bionic\"" chip? People don't need to notice your chip for a better quality. The X already have OLED display, cant you figure out something else to change the screen with that notch?\n\nParticularly for me as a photographer and videographer, I do not actually care how good it looks when I take a video on iPhone display but what matters is the physical camera, that's the game changer. You can't say that iPhone camera will beat a DSLR later or sooner, or at least a PowerShot one... Though 128GB is enough because I have to extract 4K video to my PC and delete them after that to save spaces and so I buy a WD Passport 512GB for $124 which is a really good external SSD. There's no point for me to use all 512GB on my phone and keep it all the time. I can't do heavy load video editing on iPhone. \n\nAnyways, I know that around the world not many people know about the tech specs but at least show them something that they SHOULD know before spending their money, you were once the company that teaches your consumers what great about the iPhone. Nowadays, people buy iPhone more than I see people buy TVs on Black Friday and they don't even care about the specs or what changes in the new iPhone.\n\nWhat I think about the X and 7 Plus are the 2 of the best so far for me particularly and Note 9 is a good competitor because it has most of the thing like iPhone.\n\nI can't talk much in this comment but please, understand for me and everyone else who doesn't have that much money for a piece of a fancy device like that.\n\nP/S: I know that if any people comment in here, some of them will call me \""Android fanboy\"". No. I am not an Android user but I'm disappointed a lot and lose faith in Apple. If you can tell me ANYTHING that is good about the Xs or the Xs Max over the X then you beat me."""

My spare iPhone 6 is a bit janky now and the battery life has taken a hit.\nThe improvements to portrait mode are welcome, as the generic blur regardless of distance was a dead giveaway that it's fake.\nHmmm taking the amount of the speed improvements with a grain of salt. When something only exists in the results of one synthetic benchmark, and nowhere else, it tends to make me question if that one test is valid. Remember when the A11 was claimed to be almost 200% faster? I own that, and it is slower than the HTC U11 which I also own.\nRegarding the camera, I'm ok with the module being a bit larger, as long as it isn't thicker. Being in the corner makes tabletop typing a problem when I'm eating lunch, which I tend to do on most days ;)\nBy the XS camera being almost as good as the Pixel 2, that means that it's also almost as good as the P20 Pro and HTC U12, correct?"""

Both the Xs and the Xs Max both now have gigabit radios which allow 1000 megabit download wireless speeds.  Sure, 5G is not implemented yet but one feature has been. 4X MIMO.  Multiple in Multiple out.  It\u2019s the feature which allows combining 4 different bands to increase the bandwidth of data downloads.  Think 4 times the speed to do app updates, for example.  The iPhone X has 2X MIMO while this years upgrade has 4X.  This is a significant improvement.  The reason for the weird line next to the speaker on the Xs and the Xs Max is because Apple had to increase the number of antennas from 2 to 4 which forced the line at the bottom of the Xs and Xs Max. This changed provided the ability to have 4X MIMO.  With software upgrades the Xs and Xs Max are therefore 5G ready. Important but little understood improvements.  The Xs and Xs Max also have 2X MIMO for WiFi. This means when using Personal Hotspot others who have MIMO in their phones will see a significant improvement in downloading speed.  All in all an excellent upgrade which should be better marketed so people can better take advantage of these features."""

They are, as is the case with every new iPhone, aimed at people coming from OLDER iPhones (such as 7, 6s or even 5s/5). \n\nThe idea that Apple makes iPhones ONLY for those who bought last year's iPhone is INSANE. You don't buy an iPhone every year (!) unless you are a famous Youtuber or are filthy rich. \n\nMOST people that buy one use their iPhone for AT LEAST 2-3 years (some for '5' years, even) before upgrading. Unlike Android flagships, iPhones are traditionally extremely future-proof: the '5S', which released all the way back in *2013*, is STILL getting software updates & running smooth as butter in '2018'.\n\nSo.. The industry-first '7 nm processor', the '8-core ML neural engine', the crazy-powerful GPU & ALL the other super hardware upgrades that might seem 'overkill' today are actually there, IRONICALLY enough, so 'people WON'T need to buy a new iPhone for the next few years'..  \n\nReviewers always fail to take all that into account & end up judging the latest iPhone purely in relation to how it stacks up against its immediate predecessor: So they simply quote the '15%' jump in this and '30%' boost in that.

Stating the fact that Apple introduced the Portrait mode with Iphone 7 Plus, it still really looks so artificial besides than that of Google and Huawei."""

Before his time (not that it's impossible for him to have heard of them, he probably has), there was an Australian rock band called INXS (pronounced In Excess) that was pretty big worldwide in the 80s and into the early 90s. So for anyone who was a fan of them or was influenced by them, the XS name, as much as Apple says \""it's pronounced \""ten\"" not \""X\"",\"" just sounds like \""Excess.\"" Which fits right in with the price. That's what I think they were going for, not extra small. (As an INXS fan, maybe I should have an XS, but I'm still happy with my 6s.)\n\nAnd no shit you're not seeing a big difference between the X and the XS in terms of speed. Those of us who can only afford to buy a phone every few years are gonna see a huge difference. But while I like the form factor well enough, my 6s is still running just as good as it did when I got it in 2016. I can't really afford a new iPhone, so why buy one when the one I have runs great? When I need a new one, I will gladly pay for the model I really want, and I'll take care of it and expect many years of service from it.\n\nIn case any Android guys wander in and actually get this far, I've run Android before. Four Android phones, three of which were flagships. I literally cannot afford to use Android. It's priced me out. An Android phone runs great for a few months, acceptably for a few months, and then it's lag city. So you factory reset it, and then it runs good, but not for the same few months, it's less. Then you unlock the bootloader and flash custom firmware, but it has a bug so you have to flash the next one, and then there's a different bug. Each time you flash, it's like 10-15 minutes waiting for that first boot. What if there's an emergency? You're not gonna get that call. Two and a half years into owning my first iPhone, I didn't know smartphones could hold up so well, so long. Didn't think it was possible. The idea that I can have the same phone for 3 years and not hate it, maybe 4, maybe 5... maybe even six years. I'll happily buy a $1000 or $1200 phone that will last me six years. I won't pay $800-$1000 for an Android phone that will last one, and then another year on custom firmware that may or may not work right. I just can't afford that."""

If possibly you find this of interest please create a vlog about EMUI and the fact that it continues to not only be just simply hated on but more so constantly compared to pure Android as I truly and strongly think at some point probably within 3 to 4 years it will become the mobile industry's third major software choice and while it may not be called EMUI then there is a huge and much larger reason the mate 10 pro deal with ATT fell through at the last hour as of course the US government says China would, will and has hacked the US mobile network industry, I have no doubt that Apple played the largest role and factor in regard to Huawei not gaining full US free market enterprise as they are the only mobile company who truly and I say truly poses a real threat to the fact that apple is able to dictate their own profit margins within the US and is able for the most part to force sell their products meaning or example lack of headphone jack and the usage of proprietary ports off of not innovation but more so greed and money compared to Android and say the usage of the USB c type port for the iPhone. There is a strong reason Mac books have a headphone jack and uses a USB c type port vs an iPhone. \n\nSo if this finds you and you see interest in the topic with your powerful voice I would love to hear or see a vlog in regard to EMUI not truly being Android and that it should not be compared to Android as Huawei never created it for it to be in the first place. It's only a matter of time as apple can only buy their time so long until Huawei does finally gain US free enterprise and at that point will rival apple in a way that no other mobile company is capable of which or includes the seamless integration of all their products being able to be utilized in a similar manner to that of apple. I'll end this with one strong example. Samsung. Best screen technology in the world to the point that apple themselves invests in their advanced screen or resolution tech. Then take the fact that Samsung and Huawei probably the two heaviest Android skins within the entire Android market and Samsung has this ongoing issue with lag, choppy and sticky OS after a period of use but if you use EMUI every bit as heavy if not more yet you get a almost and I mean basically zero lag seamless fluidity type OS even on top of Android I just don't see why this point has not been of major topic and is so widely unnoticed.

N/A,"""2018-09-19T04:04:22.000Z""","""David Kashton vlogs Conn""",N/A,"""Man I'm sure this comment won't find you but having started my own tech tubing channel as I have always professionally wrote about mobile tech mainly Huawei Honor and EMUI. I by the way am a huge fan and have for the most part been right on que with my articles and I suppose speculations in regard to what I believe to be the brilliance with and behind EMUI and the type of brand and company Huawei is even all the while being a pretty hardcore apple user, I have to say you are really one of a kind at what you do and have accomplished being that you are so young yet well so wise beyond your young years. I've been a subscriber to your channel for a while now and I remember you saying once your first vlog you ever published got like 12 views. I just am blown completely away by that one statement compared to what you have done and accomplished in comparison to that very first vlog you spoke of. You said that on one of your Q and A vlogs and as a very very young tech tuber now I've even had over 30 views on my first vlog yet I only have 5 subscribers lol. I'm not even sure what type of revenue someone like yourself where you stand now generates from being a vlog creator but being a highly educated guy like myself would have to truly imagine you to be doing quite well. Congrats and I think by far and away you are the best at what you do have done and I'm quite sure will continue to do. I am not sure if you are done with school yet but even if you aren't man you have for certain created and found your calling and from my point of view sure higher learning higher degrees education is a good thing but at this point you basically have that of a PhD in your world and profession. If this message finds you please message me and give me some for the lack of better words very first vlogging advice as I've even thought about just not doing any more as sticking to the writing thing. I have always been the type to talk like I write and write like I talk and to do that for me is like to think without thought so possibly I could be approaching this tech tubing in an entirely wrong manner. I'd definitely love to hear and soak up a bit of advice and feedback from someone like yourself that has basically written the book on what you do as I see you as talent and highly educated and one whom especially has a lot of common logic not to be mistaken for common sense which the two have their own sets of rules but basically you are the best brother. I congratulate you and I think it's a unbelievable accomplishment to say you had maybe 12 views on your first vlog and take that statement and compare it to where you sit right this very minute and second. My vlogs if you can even call them that are not even able to be compared to yours but being one who is of a higher education high IQ I think knowledge is very powerful and with that power of knowledge brings acute awareness and with that comes the ability to adapt and learn so man you have done some truly amazing feats that sincerely only the very best to brilliant can bring to life. Hope you get this as I sincerely mean every word I wrote. Message me if you do read this and I'd more than enjoy and appreciate taken in any type of suggestions, advice and feedback you have to offer me. Lastly early last year I was basically doing my thing which was posting lots of articles, blogs and probably more forum posts than anything but from that I was contacted by mobile Nations or Android central which at the time I thought to be spam emails and was told I had won this writing contest and award and that I was not chosen nationally once by their board but twice for the same contest/award that I was competing in yet I had zero clue there was even a contest going on yet I won it and was nationally chosen twice. I knew I could write as I for the most part for the first half of my career wrote a lot of narrative style market reports after having researched and extracted tons of market data to create a end result of a detailed written report but my skills in writing I did not realize to be at a level of per say like nationally recognized but yet they were. I'm no longer affiliated with mobile Nations as evidently you have to have very very thick skin which is in part what I'd thoroughly enjoy hearing you message me about as I don't know if it was jealousy or just power hungry mods kept singling me out to the point of one pubicly degrading me on the forums saying I had poor grammar and couldn't write to which I finally fired back and of course got myself banned from mobile Nations lol. I unleashed upon the head director and I told him flat out everything in life stems from the top. I regret it now as I was well on my way within that arena to at least become a tech reviewer and writer which I allowed one power hungry mod whom I presume knew who I was to get to me and I of course told him some very choice to think without thought words then to let the head of mobile Nations hear the same and I blew a good thing so if this message does find you and you have any thoughts or suggestions that could possibly get me back in the door that I without knowing had unlocked and walked through to have it be opened back up through tech tubing or just any other general suggestions, please do let me know. I'd say my expertise is Huawei Honor and EMUI as I from day one experiencing the OS knew it was not Android, not meant to be Android nor would it or will it forever be Android and I have written tons of content in regard to that over the past almost three years. \n\nAnyways man keep up the brilliance and many many congrats to what you have accomplished. \n\nDon"""
