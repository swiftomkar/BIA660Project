It looks incredible, for many reasons...\n\nFirstly - that screen is amazing. It doesn't flicker, there's no reflection, it goes all the way to the edge... it doesn't even look like a screen, it looks like print! I've never seen anything like it before. It looks just like a special effect and not real.\n\nAs for the camera, I'm kind of in shock. I am not a cellphone user myself, and haven't looked at them for a while. Last time I checked, cellphones cameras were just a joke, with terrible quality and resolution. Not worth using except as a toy. But this camera is AMAZING - it looks as good as real camera, in fact it looks better than many real cameras. How can a camera so SMALL be so good?\n\nAnd this leaves me very confused about *why* Apple have put such a sophisticated camera is a mainstream cellphone? This cellphone is going to be used by millions of people, the vast majority of whom have no interest in photography. So why is Apple giving them this ridiculously sophisticated camera? Is it trying to get everyone interested in photography? I just don't get it. It's almost insulting to photographers that the mass public are being given this great camera which they didn't ask for.\n\nAnd then I have to mention that interface. WOW. The way you can just move your thumb and flick windows around like that. It's so powerful, so responsive. The interface almost looks more impressive than a real computer. It's quite incredible. To be honest I hate touchscreen, would never use it, and have no interest in it, which is part of the reason I've never even looked at smartphones before. But when I see a video like this I can almost begin to understand the appeal.\n\nGenerally, I think Apple are a terrible company who make shoddy, horrible, over-priced products that I always hate, and I wouldn't go near an Apple product. But I have to say, it looks like they've finally got their act together with this product. It's so advanced, it's like something out of a sci-fi film. Incredible.\n\nI won't be buying a cellphone any time soon though. I still don't see any real point in owning one. I already have a telephone and computer. I don't need an all-in-one device, and certainly would not like to have to carry the gadget around with me everywhere I went. That would drive me nuts!"""

And with Apple Care, if something happens to my phone, it's replaced free of charge. Most phones with wireless charging have glass backs, and I use a case so it's not a big deal for me.

On a  wide screen mode movie....If you split the screen in half from top to bottom, and the other half is what you will be watching...that how small the screen will be displaying.

I keep those for the first half of the day while the battery is full (on my old iphone, new X battery lasts longer) then when I have to charge the phone, I switch to my bluetooth air pods and tadaa. No problem. You don't need a headphone jack. That's not to say that I haven't ever wished it had one, because if you forget the lightning ear buds or adapter, you are basically screwed when the bluetooth headphones die, but like I said, you get used to it. And you need to, cuz the 3.5mm jack is gone. I dislike how they went back to having to hold down programs in the carousel and then hit the minus button, that's a step back from just swiping the program up to close it.

The Top Notch is wasted space as too much is crammed into to little space and why could Apple not merge Notifications and Quick Settings like Android and allow users to just pull down on one side of the notch to access all the functions (Notification & Quick Settings!) to make it easier on people with small hands and people that are left handed?\n\nThe New Camera angle while ok just still does not look as good as the older iPhone 7 Plus set up also why does the Camera Hump have to be so big surely Apple could shrink it down like Oppo managed to do or make the phone made thicker heaven forbid to allow for a bigger to aloow for a bigger battery and thus much longer battery life (Yes I do know they use two batterys in an L shape giving it better life thanks to a stcked Logic/Mother Board but that just ads to my argument of making the back thicked not thinner!) and help flatten out the camera bump as a result!\n\nFace ID has been hacked yes it is a nice idea like Samsungs Iris Scanner but use it in addtion to Touch ID which many people would still have loved to see either in the screen (Many people belive that Apple got it working but dropped it due to cost and having to remove the haptic engine!) or maybe put it in the Apple Logo on the back that makes sense right?! (BTW this again adds to my argument of a slightly thicker device!) Or maybe due a Sony and put the Touch ID in the side mounted power button!\n\nStill no unlocked NFC to allow people to transfer files fast and easy, This is nothing to do with security as Apple Claims (As Blutooth and WiFi are much much bigger threats and Apple still includes them without locking them!) but to Force Banks to use their Apple Pay so they can take a chunck of the profit while with Android you can use a banks defualt apps to pay or use Android Pay or even Samsung Pay if you have a Sammy device, Apple locking NFC only to payments and only on Apple Pay is Anti-Competitive under Australian/New Zealand and I belive US Law to name just two/three!\n\nStill no option to change icons or ability to add luanchers to customize ones personal device!\n\nStill no option to set defualt apps you are forced to use Apple's Apps!\n\nNo Battery Percentage display opton now even in Control Center?!"""

I much preferred the social aspects of the 5s over the self gratifying multitude of personalization of the note 5. The switch to the 7 from the 5s was less noticeable to me, considering they both functioned the same and had minor feature differences. The 7 plus had an obvious larger screen, which made it a plus. Other than that it was very much the same as the 5s.  \n\nHaving the X now, I am loving it! The notches, for me, add to the phone, rather than create an annoyance. Learning the new \""controls\"" seemed to come naturally; I quickly found myself trying to use my work 7 the way a X functions and I became annoyed by the older way of doing things. The notches add straight forward swiping points and the upward swipe is what made the 7 annoying to use. I love swiping up to close permanently and temporarily. \n\nThe added features, AR and facial recognition aren't a major factor for me. The screen and how the phone commands work, make the X more streamlined and hard to go back to an older version. The social side of iPhone is why I couldn't go to any other OS. Droid phones had to many distracting features and were antisocial in the fact that people can easily be caught up in there own phone decorating their screen and text messages were limited to a certain number of characters."""

When placing the screen of the X next to The 8 plus I see no massive difference bearing in mind I am an average consumer ( which most people are). The Face ID is definitely slower than Touch ID.\u00a0\n\nThe X is going back and I am ordering the 8 plus.

I\u2019ve allowed it to slide for a while, but now it's starting to become a major issue. I'll share just a few of my gripes on this comment... 01) AirDrop inconsistencies. My iPhone X refuses to recognize my other Apple devices to AirDrop to them. This is something that should NOT be a headache... 02) Apple has no excuse for missing features that should be on EVERY phone. For example: OPTIONS. We should have Face ID and the fingerprint. We should have the option to swipe after Face ID unlocks the phone or to forgo the swipe option. We should be able to \""delete all\"" EVERYWHERE that it applies (i.e. multitasking, voicemail, etc). I could go on forever, but I'll stop there. 03) Who is the genius (sarcasm) that is choosing the gestures. The fact is that there are COUNTLESS options that could have been implemented that would make the iPhone X a cinch to use with one hand. Why do we have to swipe from the top of the device for the control center and notification center. How about swiping down for the mid-right for notification center and mid-left for notifications. It's NOT that hard, but Apple seems to be clueless about such things. \u2014\u2013\u2013 These are just a few of the reasons why the iPhone X is not worth it's price tag. It's a beautiful device and does a lot of things well. But iOS is starting to feel like a half-baked operating system. I like my meals fully cooked. Peace!"""

Face ID is good, but it\u2019s not perfect, but touch ID was perfect. And everyone will prefer touch ID to Face ID. As an electronics engineer, I get it to why apple removed touch ID. They removed it cus simply there was no place to put it. We can't put the fingerprint reader underneath the display cus that technology simply doesn't exist and it will be really difficult to invent that technology. Putting the fingerprint reader on the power button is theoretically ok, but practically there are lots of faults. Apple can\u2019t put a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone because it will ruin their whole seamless design, and it will look ugly. But I think i may have found a solution. At the back of the iPhone apple has their apple logo. That logo placement is perfect and its really easy to reach. Why can't we put the fingerprint reader on the apple logo. It would work perfectly. Fingerprint reader will be shaped to the apple logo, and made from ceramic. It will perfectly blend in, I will work just like touch ID, and it will not ruin the back design of the phone. The only downside is I don\u2019t know what effect it will have with wireless charging. But other than that, it\u2019s a perfect solution. \n-Randeera Liyanage-"""

Second, why can't the phone just unlock with Face ID instead of the user having to swipe up after unlocking...touch ID is so easy...all you do is touch the home button and you unlock the phone and it goes to the home screen, or last app. Why can't face ID do this? Third, the app switching. Why must you swipe up and hold (or even swipe up and over), and then hit the red subtract button to get rid of apps? It is so much better to just swipe up and close apps.

The Face Recognition looks pretty good My s8 works but its not brilliant. Wireless charging well I had that on my Nexus 4 (when was that? 2014?)  not overly armoured by that selling point, fast charging well had that since the S6 which was 2015? I'm happy for all those apple users that they now have a phone that packs everyday features but its gonna cost them \u00a31200 for the privilege. Apple where once the shining light of quality and performance, but Android and its protagonists have very much caught up. There is still the Android premium gap in the market I think essential tried to fill it but not with the PH-1. I think Samsung could potentially fill as their quality has improved 10 fold but it they wont let go f the S brand. Could the premium come from China? I'm fully expecting the Mi7 from Xiaomi to be a very elegant phone and I'm very much looking forward to that and thats not to mention the 5T that arrived yesterday.\n\nIts the Form Factor The Iphone/S8 size is the premium Market - Small but packs a huge punch.

I like the design, a mix of the various iPhones, well done, but I can't see a so dramatic change between OLED and LCD retina for now. It is better but not to justified the price. I don't mind too much about the notch until you want to watch a video, then the screen becomes same as a normal iphone 7 or 8. They need to work on it. When you move the iPhone X around you can see the oled screen is a bit bluish like lot of reviewers said already and this is not the best. I like the new gestures which replace the home button. But in general I have to say, I won't change my iPhone 7plus with the X for now. It is just a bigger iPhone 8 with better screen and slightly better camera then a 8plus(the stabilizer in the telephoto lens is not that great). I prefer reading and watching videos with the plus and as well if the X camera is much better when you take videos with it the camera app looks small like in the iPhone 8, much much better to have the plus as viewfinder. Surfing internet, reading through an app, watching videos, all of those actions still look better in the plus to me, the X don't take advantages of the \""larger\"" (maybe just longer) screen. I will wait September to see the X plus 6.5inch, 6.1 and the 6.1 LED, if the rumors are true those are more interesting. This X looks like the iPhone 2 before the release of the 3, an experiment before the right one... doesn't worth 1000$ for me, much better the combo iPhone 8plus+iWatch 3+airpods. The last 2 are the best apple products until now (waiting for the iMac pro...)."""

Apple has been, for instance,  years ahead of the competition with processors since the iPhone 5s came out, 4 years ago; yet you talk about specs, as if having more RAM or an extra MP would make your experience that much better (or at all, for that matter). I bet you people barely even know what a CPU is, or what makes it better or worse than others; have you ever at least read AnandTech\u2019s reviews of iPhones\u2019 CPUs and shit? Yeah, I didn\u2019t think so\u2026 And I won\u2019t even get into Apple\u2019s new custom-designed GPU\u2026 You\u2019re gonna tell me you don\u2019t need that much power on a phone, now? Then, why the fuck would you need fucking 4\u20138 GBs of RAM on one! Basically, you don\u2019t give a shit about specs when the iPhone\u2019s winning, but specs are all that matter to you when Android phones have the lead? What kind of fucked up logic is that? I can\u2019t even believe this shit\u2026\n\nAnd yeah, Samsung and others might've incorporated various features before Apple did, so what? Just compare Samsung\u2019s facial recognition system to the iPhone X\u2019s one; how could anybody possibly, even, fucking ever prefer to have something half-baked and defective a little before, than having something that actually works and makes your experience better, a little later? You gotta be fucking kidding me\u2026 Yeah, Apple clearly rushed iOS 11 as well and I hate that they did it; but it still runs fucking circles around the competition. I didn\u2019t even give a shit about smartphones or computers before knowing Apple (yeah, I hated Windows before even knowing Apple existed); but Apple made technology magical and enjoyable for me, among other things; and if it weren\u2019t for Apple, I would now be studying fucking linguistics instead of software engineering.\n\nStill, the biggest \u201cadvantage\u201d I see in Android would be its customizability, but wtf do I care about that? I don\u2019t even change the wallpaper nor the icons\u2019 position on my iPhone, so I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t change a fucking thing. Meanwhile, I\u2019d suffer every single day from its lagginess, user-hostility, I would miss my favorite games and apps that are exclusive to iOS (the highest-end games and most professional apps for programmers and developers), and I\u2019d lose all magic connection with my MacBook (and I\u2019ll die before going back to that fucking nightmare called Windows); so, why would I ever switch? And\u2026 how could anyone ever say the iPhone\u2019s behind? Because Galaxies got features nobody uses, and cuz it had a gimmicky and shitty facial recognition from before? Or is it cuz it\u2019s got some extra GBs or RAM I literally wouldn\u2019t even notice? I don\u2019t really like iPhone X, btw; and I\u2019m not even trynna defend Apple so much, as I\u2019m honestly flummoxed by Apple haters/Android fans\u2019 incoherence (and boy, do I fucking hate incoherence). If you\u2019re a special kind of user, and for whatever reason the competition offers you something that Apple surprisingly doesn\u2019t, then you might just be a different kind of user with different needs; but if you stupidly claim the iPhone\u2019s objectively behind when facts prove otherwise, and you talk nonsensical shit about Apple without even knowing wtf you\u2019re talking about, then you put the fucking \u201cretard\u201d in \u201cretarded\u201d, and it\u2019s fucking pathetic and infuriating. I\u2019d still prefer Apple if they were behind, and in some way, I would respect if you did the same; but I\u2019d like it for real, actual reasons, instead of making up shitty alternative facts (yeah, I just said that:p)."""

I don't want to compare it to an Android because the last time I've used Android was four years ago.\n\n\n\n\nI just find it too expensive compared to the iPhone 8 or especially to the new price for the iPhone 7. Yes, it has gestures but so has BlackBerry. Personally I like the home button and the satisfying feedback it offers. I like the finger print sensor. I don't want to use gestures for everything as that's how the BlackBerry Passport worked and they're a pain in the ass to use when your fingers are wet and it misinterprets input.\n\n\n\n\nThe camera and everything may be great but it is $1000! You can get three iPhones 6 with this money, new. You can get two iPhones 7 used. It's $300 more expensive than the new iPhone 8 and brings just the Face ID and the new screen. Sorry but while technically is impressive, this is hardly value for money.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI find more value for money in the 12.9 iPad + keyboard (that's cheaper btw) than in this phone. These are not phones anymore. These are fashion statements. These are in the same category as a watch or a pair of good shoes. From the entire line-up, I'm starting to find the iPhone the least useful device. The iPad can be used as a laptop replacement. The MacBook is still a workhorse for getting things done. The iPhone was great, at $600, not at $1000.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe only good thing about the iPhone X is that the price of the old iPhones dropped or are going to drop significantly."""

For example, most of the time if not all, you don\u2019t unlock the phone right away till after you turn on the screen and check if there\u2019s new notifications, so with Face ID by the time you\u2019ve done checking, the phone is already done unlocking. Better yet, you can get right into the specific notification by tapping it since the phone is already unlocked VS having the extra step to unlock the phone on a Touch ID phone before you can launch the specific modification. As for the gestures, I\u2019ve always made my phones work just like that whenever I was able to jailbreak or root in the past.

And Apple didn't pay him dumbasses. It was actually his honest opinion. If it was an Android, would you say the same thing? Damn, Android fans are dumb as hell.

Apple was late to the full-screen party  and only came after the success of other brands. This review also makes too many excuses for iOS shortcomings, dismissing them with, \u201cWell, that\u2019s Apple.\u201d No, that\u2019s actually Apple being arrogant. Sure, the hardware chips and camera may be better than, say, the Note 8, but it was released 6 months later. Similarly, the Note 9 designers will be able to \u201cadjust\u201d for the X\u2019s features. And speaking of \u201cfeatures,\u201d Animojis is not one; those who think it is need to get a life; at best, it\u2019s a novelty, and certainly not one to justify buying an X. Overall, i found the X boring; this is the first time I\u2019m not \u201cupgrading\u201d to a new iPhone after one or two years. The X may, indeed, be the best iPhone yet, but it\u2019s far, far from being perfect, and note that he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best smartphone. I\u2019m waiting to see what comes out next year, from all brands. Given Apple\u2019s track record of recent years, I expect the XI (or whatever it\u2019s called) to be incrementally \u2014 but only incrementally \u2014  better, but still staid.

It\u2019s a lot easier.\n\nI find the glass is amazing on the iPhone. It\u2019s always smooth to the touch. Other than Samsung phones, I don't think I've used any other phone that has an amazing glass when touching and interacting with the display. Disregarding the resolution and numbers. The actual quality of the screen and glass is crazy good. Things look a little cinematic. I find Samsung phones have a similar feeling on their displays. And I do understand they\u2019re the manufactured by Samsung. So it only makes sense. \n\nThe stainless steel looks distracting and chrome like on the silver one. I\u2019m glad I went with the slate.\n\nI also find it weird the camera is on the right side instead of the left or at least centered. I cover it up and put smudges on it naturally because I\u2019m right-handed. So when I pick it up or put it down my fingers are on it. Not a big deal. Just something I notice. \n\nWhen it comes to the notch, I like it to be honest. I like the smaller one on the Essential too. It looks futuristic to me. It\u2019s different from what we\u2019re used to. \n\nI do find that the iPhone handles notifications poorly imo compared to Android. I can check the notification in the app and that same notification will still be on the notification page. If the notification is many minutes old then you can dismiss them all with the X. Otherwise, there is no clear or dismiss button. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought it was a bit dumb to keep most of the settings for apps in a separate settings application. Why can\u2019t we access those dedicated settings for the app within the app we\u2019re using like on Android? Why should we exit out of an app to go to the settings app just to change settings for the app I had to exit out of?\n\nAll in all, I think the phone is pretty sweet. Just waiting for my penguin Pixel Xl 2 to ship. *sigh*"""

This phone is Apple's attempt to finally catch up to Android, and add a feature or two instead or removing them like they did with the iPhone 7.

We used to think paying \u00a3300 for a phone was insane. This tech is now less user friendly with the swipe gestures, the test was whether an elderly person could easily use it. I dunno, I've had iPhones for a while and used to be pumped for each one... This one and back to the 6s all don't do anything for me... they all seem very basic changes or ones that benefit apple but not me. The design of the overall phone is dated, the notch is not actually improving the phone as it actually cuts into things. The last few iPhones have pushed me to no looking at Android's highend market for my phone. I love tech, I buy all sorts of tech just to see how good it is, but the iPhone is almost predictable as soon as you see what features it will have, there isn't a WOW factor to the phones, it's more of a \""what? why would they do that?\"" factor. for a \u00a31000, it's a little too steep, that's a massive proportion of my pay... for that, I expect a perfect user experience, I use my phone for videos and photos a lot. I've bought phones on their usability, their camera, their screens and their wow factor. This misses the mark on that (for me). The animoji are a gimmick that anyone could do on any phone, it's just they hyped this up to sound like it was new tech, it just smells of \""let's just pack it with random stuff that do things...\"" I'm an apple fan and android, but apple just don't have that flair that they used to have, where each phone seemed like a step into the unknown. The tech is no longer leading edge, it's \""that'll do\"" Face ID is not a logical solution, it's just the one that allowed them to get no bezels. I'm one person with my views, others will love it and buy it, I just hope that this doesn't set a precedent for the average phone cost going up to \u00a31,000, which will in turn make our phone contracts worth a lot more. It's insane that we used to think it was expensive to pay \u00a310 a month 10 years ago(Now I feel old) and \u00a325 sounds cheap now. people regularly pay \u00a330-\u00a350... there are other factors too, but I'm questioning when it will be that we realise these contracts are making us pay through our nose for something that actually doesn't cost that much to run. I hope we see quality products at reasonable prices back on the shelves soon. An iPhone 5 at the time of production cost about \u00a350-\u00a380 to produce and they've all been around that price since. I know this as I've studied Product Design and our Lecturer worked through getting one put together as if he was Apple, there are design costs too but with the sales of the phone, they become extremely small. So after all the costs surrounding designing, making, distributing, sales, they were making anything from 150% to 300% markup... I don't think it should be free phones, I understand they need to make a profit, but the price hikes are huge, but what we are receiving is actually not that proportion better. Moore's Law says that tech halves in price or doubles in speed or quality every 2 years (now closer to 2 and a half) This should mean that iPhones get cheaper overall or not go up in price much.\nLong rant over.\nLove the vids, please keep going, I'm a total tech lover, and iPhone or not, it's your money, your life, enjoy whatever tech you have!"""

And it's the same thing with swipe-left/right at bottom to switch apps. Other iPhones can do that if it was programmed in the software. --\u00a0That Apple restricts some features/possibilities within the software to make their flagship \""more\"" special is just disappointing.\u00a0\n\nI've always used iPhone since 3GS model. I love iPhones (having owned also 4, 6 plus, and now SE), and mostly the reason of why I've been sticking to it is the ecosystem (together with iPad and Macs). Besides, upgrading to 4 was worth it (retina and front camera). Upgrading to 6 plus was worth it (bigger screen+battery finally). Buying SE (missed smaller sized phone). And now, I miss the bigger screen and planning to upgrade, but so far I'm not convinced if X is worth it.\u00a0\n\nIs Animoji worth the extra cost? For me personally, No. Sure it's fun to have, but I don't need that.. Is Face ID worth the extra cost? Maybe it's more convenient, but like mentioned in the review, Touch ID works the same if not better and I don't mind using a finger to unlock the phone.\u00a0\n\nSure I could go for the 8 or 8 plus, but the design though with the same huge bezels. After all I pointed out, the ONLY reason for me to still buy an iPhone for my next phone is the ecosystem it is part of. Which leaves me the question: Do I really need a phone that is part of that ecosystem? I often use my phone to edit documents on iCloud, and I have headphones that take advantage of the W1 chip. Are these two features worth sacrificing for a new exciting experience with an Android-phone, or should I go for the 8/X that doesn't really offer any changes I have use for?"""

This could perhaps allow the phone to look for you at a more shallow angle. \n\nSo it\u2019s a good move from Apple. \n\nI think the real pace is still being set by Samsung. If Samsung brings out the S9 at \u00a3900 with a better package than the iPhone X. Apple will have to react. \n\nMany people still think the S8 Plus and Note 8 is better than the iPhone X. \n\nApple therefore has a good design now and a future look for the next couple of years. \n\nApple will have to bring down its cost. This isn\u2019t because Apple wants to be more cheap. This is purely because the S9 will out to grab as many Apple users as possible. \n\nIf you look through the comments, you will notice the Samsung, Google and LG have great phones out as well. \n\nCompetition is based on performance and price. \n\nApple can\u2019t sell phones which are \u00a3230 more expensive than Samsung\u2019s flagship.

I have a theory: no one really does look at the status bar constantly. All the focus goes to the middle of the screen. It\u2019s also scientifically proven that the moment a person sees something new, their initial focus is all in the middle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for some people to realise the big picture or their minds choose to see one thing when the whole thing is the correct perception. Going back to the notch, your focus stays in the middle of the screen. The only time you\u2019d notice the notch is when you are deliberately looking for something in the status bar. Be it time, battery, or network connection, you still don\u2019t look at those things constantly. That\u2019s why the notch seems to \u201cdisappear\u201d in use. Obviously, the notch doesn\u2019t literally disappear, but rather, our minds choose not to see the notch on top. That\u2019s why the notch is not a problem at all. If you come to think about it, the notch and ears are just merely extensions of the new screen. Don\u2019t think of it as a lose, but as a gain. You get extra screen on top, which can be used for then new status bar."""

Instead improve your research and design to get everything to work without losing important functionality. That is the true test of good design, and why I'm sticking with Samsung for now.

But, my 6s is still going strong, so I'm going to hold onto that. My 6s is my first ever iPhone after 6 years of Android phones, and while I miss some of Android's extra features, I like the stability of iOS. I have never had an Android phone not shit the bed after 12-18 months. It's just what Android does, it collapses under its own weight and bloat. A factory reset usually sorts it for a while, but then it's not gonna go another 12-18 months, more like 3-4 if you're lucky. I'm constantly blown away that my iPhone continues to be good. And I'm still blown away that having an icon below or to the right of a blank space is so hard for Apple. For a smartphone, particularly a big one, screen content should flow from the bottom to the top from user operated controls to content that is merely meant to be viewed. If I'm meant to interact with it, it should be closer to the bottom. If I'm not, push it to the top. So naturally I want my icons along the bottom, but not so much along the top."""

I've seen this trend amongst the top YouTubers in recent years, (includes you) of not being critical enough. Even criticism is kind of sugar coated.\n\nI'm considering the iPhone X for my mom, but I've come across the following criticisms (read on reddit) which unfortunately neither you, nor others have even touched.\n\n1. The insane repair cost of front/back panel.\n\n2. The turtle-slow wireless charging and slow fast charging (saw mrwhoseyourboss's video) and the exclusion of fast charging.\n\n3. The strategy to sell 256 GB by not offering 128 GB. Should be informed imo, coz well, with 4k @ 60 fps, we all know how easy it is to full your storage. \n\n4. The bugs in iOS 11 which makes it seem like a beta, which makes the phone slower than the Android flagships. (A lot of discussions over reddit on this)\n\n5. A word on comparison between the amoled of the X and the one on the Samsungs.\n\n6. Whether the 8 plus makes more sense over the X. \n\nI know there's an intangible force  that doesn't allow YouTubers to be hyper-critical of the iPhones, but these ought to be covered. Unfortunately, I was hearing the same stuff what I've heard a million times over. The good."""

Maybe it's just me, but I always rapidly swipe up to close apps 1 by 1 and that gets a little tedious sometimes.\nIt would also be nice if iPhones had expandable storage and also swapped to USB-C.\nI heard that Face ID has issues with those things as well as identical twins being able to unlock it.\n\nOh and it would've been nice if the iPhone had an optional, software enabled home button like the Galaxy phones.\n\nRegardless of what phone you buy, you're going to be spending a lot of money so you might a well get a good case for like $30 ~ $50.

I really wanted to get the XL because of the small bezels, but I hate big phones. Before this, I had an iPhone 6s and I convinced myself that I could get the regular Pixel 2 because, just like Marques mentioned about the notch, I'm not looking at the bezels when I was using the phone.

I will first and openly admit, before I get a bunch of apple fans and Android haters, no phone is worth 1000 dollars. The functionality and look hasn't changed since the iPhone 5. I'm talking about color and art design. The cameras while impressive for all phones to fight, is really good. This one is probably just as impressive but man seriously? The price went up for, what to me at least as a over all user, an oled display and now a top firing speaker to run a duel speaker config. And not even good. I'm not even a Samsung fan boy anymore because even then I don't justify the design and other things that are not about this phone right now. While everyone has a right to spend their money on whatever they want and while I am clearly nobody to believe that this phone is useless to anyone except myself, I still can't believe you approved so little about this phone to justify $1000. There seriously has to be a line where enough is enough or this case there isn't enough to justify this price or idea that this is appropriate to the audience. But I digress as I prefer having a verbal conversation or rant about how I feel towards this phone than continue. Plus I am actually curious to see what thoughts and or mean comments I'm going to get for this one comment. Not trying to troll but from someone who expects a lot from an iPhone and apple themselves, I seriously am disappointed in this phone and this review. But maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture. Someone can feel free to educate me a little as even I can be ignorant to the subject. Not a challenge or troll but just seriously wanting to hear a counter argument."""

For over 3 years I have had the Droid Turbo 2. This phone is quite old but still runs circles around any idiot phone. For starters, the messages app can be customized with color coded contacts and avatars, the #\u2019s and frequently used punctuation can be accessed without switching keyboards. The driving/hands free mode is world class, iPhone doesn\u2019t even have this. And my Turbo2 recognizes smart TVs for mirrors casting from YouTube, it doesn\u2019t require an Apple TV.  Pure garbage. I will be returning this idiot phone and keeping my 2015 Motorola Droid Turbo 2.  I feel sorry for people caught up in the idiot phone gimmick."

N/A,2018-06-05T09:01:40.000Z,Lee Bee,N/A,"I've always hated Apple, but I heard their new cellphone had a really good camera, so I came and watched this video and I have to admit I simply blown away by this product! It looks incredible, for many reasons...\n\nFirstly - that screen is amazing. It doesn't flicker, there's no reflection, it goes all the way to the edge... it doesn't even look like a screen, it looks like print! I've never seen anything like it before. It looks just like a special effect and not real.\n\nAs for the camera, I'm kind of in shock. I am not a cellphone user myself, and haven't looked at them for a while. Last time I checked, cellphones cameras were just a joke, with terrible quality and resolution. Not worth using except as a toy. But this camera is AMAZING - it looks as good as real camera, in fact it looks better than many real cameras. How can a camera so SMALL be so good?\n\nAnd this leaves me very confused about *why* Apple have put such a sophisticated camera is a mainstream cellphone? This cellphone is going to be used by millions of people, the vast majority of whom have no interest in photography. So why is Apple giving them this ridiculously sophisticated camera? Is it trying to get everyone interested in photography? I just don't get it. It's almost insulting to photographers that the mass public are being given this great camera which they didn't ask for.\n\nAnd then I have to mention that interface. WOW. The way you can just move your thumb and flick windows around like that. It's so powerful, so responsive. The interface almost looks more impressive than a real computer. It's quite incredible. To be honest I hate touchscreen, would never use it, and have no interest in it, which is part of the reason I've never even looked at smartphones before. But when I see a video like this I can almost begin to understand the appeal.\n\nGenerally, I think Apple are a terrible company who make shoddy, horrible, over-priced products that I always hate, and I wouldn't go near an Apple product. But I have to say, it looks like they've finally got their act together with this product. It's so advanced, it's like something out of a sci-fi film. Incredible.\n\nI won't be buying a cellphone any time soon though. I still don't see any real point in owning one. I already have a telephone and computer. I don't need an all-in-one device, and certainly would not like to have to carry the gadget around with me everywhere I went. That would drive me nuts!"

Removing the headphone jack took \courage\? lol, Apple already was on the expensive social image prep kids market for some time, rather than the general public, alienating millions of people who prefer aux cord listening is just solidifying the obvious. The iPhone X stands against everything the original iPhone was about, which I find somewhat funny. Apple isn't what they used to be.\n\nAndroid is the most used operating system period!

For example, my iPhone X was half price with C-Spire, not to mention I traded in my old phone, bringing the cost (+$200 for Apple Care) to $600. And with Apple Care, if something happens to my phone, it's replaced free of charge. Most phones with wireless charging have glass backs, and I use a case so it's not a big deal for me. And honestly, the only headphones I use with my phone are the earbuds, which come with the phone so, once again, not a problem for me. And as you so well put it, the notch just disappears."

I always go back and forth with iPhone & Galaxy and if Samsung would fix their batteries (cause they die pretty quick) than they would be better than Apple. I love them both equally but Apple is neat and more modern looking. Still.. I like to get phones every 2 years or 3 cause it\u2019s hella expensive, I mean it\u2019s a month\u2019s rent. And no I\u2019m not hating cause I can\u2019t afford it, I just have more important priorities to take care of than a phone.. So people can stop acting like other people are poor! Plus Apple is like Samsung, they will end up messing up later on so.. it\u2019s cool they come up with new things but it would be nice not to worry about it EVERY year to get a new one and spend a lot. The glass is the thing that bugs me.. it won\u2019t last."

N/A,2018-01-24T14:40:16.000Z,nfn7121,N/A,Phone absolutely sucks.  Sent it back.  Phone is slow and to do one thing takes one or two more steps then any other iPhone.  Face ID dumb you have to do two steps first one to open the phone then swipe up.  Basically every thing you know an iPhone can do add one or two more steps.  Those steps are not quick they suck and take too long.  Nothing is better than Touch ID. Face ID is the worst concept and basically another way technology wants the screen in your face all day and will cause and kill many people with car accidents. Camera sucks for what it is. Still blurs and keep a bright light around.

As he bends over to look more closely he inadvertently breaks wind. Very embarrassed, he looks around nervously to see if anyone has noticed his little accident and prays that a sales person doesn't pop up right now. As he turns around, his worst nightmare materializes in the form of a salesman standing right behind him. Cool as a cucumber and displaying complete professionalism, the salesman greets the man with, \Good day, Mister How may we help you today?\ Very uncomfortably, but hoping that the salesman may not have been there at the time of his little \accident!\ he asks, \Sir, what is the price of this lovely iPhone X?\ He answers, \Mister, if you farted just looking at it, you're going to crap yourself when I tell you the price.\"

N/A,2018-01-06T14:38:51.000Z,Jr C,N/A,"For those that going to buy the X. Here is a little FYI: if you going to watch a lot of videos on Youtube, Netflix or whatever and expected a full screen display. You going to be disappointed. \n\nPut 2 index fingers at each end of the phone and that how much you will see on the display. On a  wide screen mode movie....If you split the screen in half from top to bottom, and the other half is what you will be watching...that how small the screen will be displaying. It's so freaking dumb and stupid, which was a reason why I returned the dam thing. \n\nThey cheated you on the video display for sure. I think video/movies display are the biggest disappointment for me on the X.  \n\nSo I exchanged for for 8+ and the darn is felt pretty heavy in your hand for a phone. With a rugged or a body armor case on the 8+ and it felt and look like a smaller version of mini IPad. \n\nSo, from a 6s + to an X,  to 8+, and back down to 7+.  I think  i'll stick with an 7+.  If you do some background setting and turn off some unnecessary apps off, you can't tell the differences in speed."

And as someone who listens to music and tv shows for HOURS everyday while I work, I can honestly say I've completely gotten used to the no headphone jack. It comes with Apple lightning ear buds, apple ear buds are always great. I keep those for the first half of the day while the battery is full (on my old iphone, new X battery lasts longer) then when I have to charge the phone, I switch to my bluetooth air pods and tadaa. No problem. You don't need a headphone jack. That's not to say that I haven't ever wished it had one, because if you forget the lightning ear buds or adapter, you are basically screwed when the bluetooth headphones die, but like I said, you get used to it. And you need to, cuz the 3.5mm jack is gone. I dislike how they went back to having to hold down programs in the carousel and then hit the minus button, that's a step back from just swiping the program up to close it. I also very much dislike how they removed battery percentage from the main screen. They should make it possible to replace the battery icon with just a percentage."

N/A,2017-12-17T23:26:08.000Z,Darth Awar,N/A,"The iPhone X's OLED Screen is made by Samsung but is around 1080p (as we know Apples Retina Displays is never the common resolution!) that is much less than the Galaxys 2K also the iPhones X's screen is less than half as bright as the Galaxy 8 & 8+ net alone the Note, also Not 18 to 9 ratio (aka 2 to 1!).\n\niOS has never had true widgets that you can place on whatever page you want and unlike Android Widgets can not resize and/or reshape them!\n\nApple stole the Control Center from Android and over time has made it more and more like Android (FIRST locked icons, then later you could add a remove icons and now with the X you even have to pull down from the top to get to it like on Android!) but yet Apple still can not or will not add an Apps Folder (even if it was set to off by defualt many many iOS users would like that option as Apple is meant to be about the clean asthetic and having 6 pages of apps by fefualt does not do that and also hides wall papers by defualt!) also the iOS version on the X has a much slower and convaluted way of accessing Home, Recent Apps excetra then even their old home button net alone Androids easy and more natural three button set up (Seriously Apple no onscreen Home Button even if it was invisible in certain apps/settings/landscape Samsung did that and it works very well! The Top Notch is wasted space as too much is crammed into to little space and why could Apple not merge Notifications and Quick Settings like Android and allow users to just pull down on one side of the notch to access all the functions (Notification & Quick Settings!) to make it easier on people with small hands and people that are left handed?\n\nThe New Camera angle while ok just still does not look as good as the older iPhone 7 Plus set up also why does the Camera Hump have to be so big surely Apple could shrink it down like Oppo managed to do or make the phone made thicker heaven forbid to allow for a bigger to aloow for a bigger battery and thus much longer battery life (Yes I do know they use two batterys in an L shape giving it better life thanks to a stcked Logic/Mother Board but that just ads to my argument of making the back thicked not thinner!) and help flatten out the camera bump as a result!\n\nFace ID has been hacked yes it is a nice idea like Samsungs Iris Scanner but use it in addtion to Touch ID which many people would still have loved to see either in the screen (Many people belive that Apple got it working but dropped it due to cost and having to remove the haptic engine!) or maybe put it in the Apple Logo on the back that makes sense right?! (BTW this again adds to my argument of a slightly thicker device!) Or maybe due a Sony and put the Touch ID in the side mounted power button!\n\nStill no unlocked NFC to allow people to transfer files fast and easy, This is nothing to do with security as Apple Claims (As Blutooth and WiFi are much much bigger threats and Apple still includes them without locking them!) but to Force Banks to use their Apple Pay so they can take a chunck of the profit while with Android you can use a banks defualt apps to pay or use Android Pay or even Samsung Pay if you have a Sammy device, Apple locking NFC only to payments and only on Apple Pay is Anti-Competitive under Australian/New Zealand and I belive US Law to name just two/three!\n\nStill no option to change icons or ability to add luanchers to customize ones personal device!\n\nStill no option to set defualt apps you are forced to use Apple's Apps!\n\nNo Battery Percentage display opton now even in Control Center?!"

I much preferred the social aspects of the 5s over the self gratifying multitude of personalization of the note 5. The switch to the 7 from the 5s was less noticeable to me, considering they both functioned the same and had minor feature differences. The 7 plus had an obvious larger screen, which made it a plus. Other than that it was very much the same as the 5s.  \n\nHaving the X now, I am loving it! The notches, for me, add to the phone, rather than create an annoyance. Learning the new \controls\ seemed to come naturally; I quickly found myself trying to use my work 7 the way a X functions and I became annoyed by the older way of doing things. The notches add straight forward swiping points and the upward swipe is what made the 7 annoying to use. I love swiping up to close permanently and temporarily. \n\nThe added features, AR and facial recognition aren't a major factor for me. The screen and how the phone commands work, make the X more streamlined and hard to go back to an older version. The social side of iPhone is why I couldn't go to any other OS. Droid phones had to many distracting features and were antisocial in the fact that people can easily be caught up in there own phone decorating their screen and text messages were limited to a certain number of characters."

I have big hands, and prefer bigger phone. Additionally, something that many people don't talk about , the plus series are WIDER, so you see bigger icons and wider pictures websites etc. It is a massive difference to me. When placing the screen of the X next to The 8 plus I see no massive difference bearing in mind I am an average consumer ( which most people are). The Face ID is definitely slower than Touch ID.\u00a0\n\nThe X is going back and I am ordering the 8 plus. Please be clear about these issues when you make reviews, as the average consumer isn't bothered about the specs its rather the practicality of the phone and every day usage."

Posting this on Cyber Monday saw $38 a month for 30 months for the X and $250 off for an I Pad vs $25 for 24 months for a Note 8 so I bought a note 8. The X isnt even a deal considering u still have to pay so much for an Iphone.

N/A,2017-11-27T15:27:40.000Z,"Marvin Rhodes, Jr.",N/A,"I love Apple products but Apple is starting to miss in too many areas that should be slam dunks. I\u2019ve allowed it to slide for a while, but now it's starting to become a major issue. I'll share just a few of my gripes on this comment... 01) AirDrop inconsistencies. My iPhone X refuses to recognize my other Apple devices to AirDrop to them. This is something that should NOT be a headache... 02) Apple has no excuse for missing features that should be on EVERY phone. For example: OPTIONS. We should have Face ID and the fingerprint. We should have the option to swipe after Face ID unlocks the phone or to forgo the swipe option. We should be able to \delete all\ EVERYWHERE that it applies (i.e. multitasking, voicemail, etc). I could go on forever, but I'll stop there. 03) Who is the genius (sarcasm) that is choosing the gestures. The fact is that there are COUNTLESS options that could have been implemented that would make the iPhone X a cinch to use with one hand. Why do we have to swipe from the top of the device for the control center and notification center. How about swiping down for the mid-right for notification center and mid-left for notifications. It's NOT that hard, but Apple seems to be clueless about such things. \u2014\u2013\u2013 These are just a few of the reasons why the iPhone X is not worth it's price tag. It's a beautiful device and does a lot of things well. But iOS is starting to feel like a half-baked operating system. I like my meals fully cooked. Peace!"

I have always set my time to 25 mins faster than real time on. Since the new software updates, all of my text messages are appearing out of order. \nExample 1: When I open a text thread and send a text now and the person replies within 25 mins the text will appear above my original text message. Also, I do not receive notifications for these text messages. \nExample 2: When I send a text to a person that does not have a prior text thread there's a delay. If the person responds within 25 mins Ill receive a notification however, I am not able to view their response till 25 mins has passed. \nJust curious if I would have the same experience on the iphone X."

So I just need about 500 dollars more to buy a iphone x just for me sense I have a crap phone, and my grandma makes me work which j am ok with but 1000 dollars dang I thought well if you really want it go for it. So I finally made enough money for a iphone x. When j had enough I went to apple store to see the use price and said one used for 1,500 dollars. So i fou d a person on facebook and meet him.

But for the record, iOS originally used to group notifications by app. Since 2010. The current implementation has only been fairly recent, since the watch came out. So it's a conscious design decision, not some \behind the times\ deal like you are making it out to be. And I happen to agree with Apple on this. The current implementation is a timeline. I much prefer it to seeing grouped by app, because then it's not as clear the order when they were received."

When he said good job Samsung for simply being a middle man and manufacturing the oled displays, when Apple did all the technical stuff in designing and patenting the display, was kinda immature and he knows better. Also how can you say that the iPhone Xs camera isn\u2019t as good as the pixel 2s with all its added far superior features. 4K at 60 FPS, slow mo at 1080p at 240 FPS, better front and back video recording quality, duel lenses with optical zoom, and studio lighting effects, and snap shots on the back cam can be just as good if not better in certain scenarios as the pixel 2s back cam. To say the pixel 2 has a better camera is just straight up biased, and pretty much just a hopeful statement to say that the pixel 2 actually has the iPhone X beat in a category, but it\u2019s straight up rubbish. The potential the iPhone X has in comparison to the pixel 2 is a big margin, and no one in their right mind should recommend a pixel over the X. The extra money for the X is well worth it \u270c\ud83c\udffc"

Face ID is good, but it\u2019s not perfect, but touch ID was perfect. And everyone will prefer touch ID to Face ID. As an electronics engineer, I get it to why apple removed touch ID. They removed it cus simply there was no place to put it. We can't put the fingerprint reader underneath the display cus that technology simply doesn't exist and it will be really difficult to invent that technology. Putting the fingerprint reader on the power button is theoretically ok, but practically there are lots of faults. Apple can\u2019t put a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone because it will ruin their whole seamless design, and it will look ugly. But I think i may have found a solution. At the back of the iPhone apple has their apple logo. That logo placement is perfect and its really easy to reach. Why can't we put the fingerprint reader on the apple logo. It would work perfectly. Fingerprint reader will be shaped to the apple logo, and made from ceramic. It will perfectly blend in, I will work just like touch ID, and it will not ruin the back design of the phone. The only downside is I don\u2019t know what effect it will have with wireless charging. But other than that, it\u2019s a perfect solution. \n-Randeera Liyanage-"

I'm upgrading from my iPhone 6 Plus which has been absolutely perfect for me since the moment I got it (it bent like 3 degrees, don't care doesn't affect me), but I feel that it's starting to lack in power and features such as 3D Touch, speed, etc. Anyways, does anyone have an honest opinion on which phone I should upgrade to?

Calls. Texts. Records video. Email. Facetime. But, clever marketing to stupid consumers makes it sell.  Why spend $1000 and not save it?? 84% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings lol.."

That screen is, as the whole phone, all form over function.\nAnd most people who buy iPhone are not practical of technology at all, so the different home button, and gestures, won't be a great thing for them. As is the glass back. \n\nAlso, I see face id is so unpractical... I usually unlock my phone before looking at it, so when I watch it it's already ready. Face Id is slower than you think, because you have to bring it up to your face before it even starts to recognize you... What if I don't wanna pick it up from a table, or can't watch directly into it. Dumb idea imho. This phone is a concept, much like the monoport MacBook 12\, and shouldn't be released to the people who decide to make their lives harder just to show they have money to waste. \nWith one of these you just look like an egocentric dumb person imho, more than with any other iPhone"

Anytime you turn your phone sideways to get a bigger, more screen filling image, you will be disappointed with this phone. The screen isn\u2019t any bigger than the older, smaller iPhones. Most content is 16x9 aspect ratio. This phone is 18x9 I think. So all 16x9 content will either have black bars left and right or, if you zoom in to fill screen, will have the top and bottom of the image cut off. Why you would ever make an 18x9 screen is beyond me. Just make it a little wider as well and the problem is solved. \n\nA lot of action movies have a 21x9 aspect ratio and this phone will actually provide a bigger image than the older phones if that\u2019s what you are watching. But who watches action movies on a 6 inch screen. \n\nTvs have a 16x9 aspect ratio. A while back they tried to make a 21x9 tv and it didn\u2019t sell very well. They learned to just keep it 16x9."

I really don't care about the price because every carrier has great financing options, including Apple, to get the phone (unless you're buying the phone outright). First, the notch...it seems really bothersome (for videos only)...you either have to deal with the notch interfering with videos or you have to deal with the black bars around the screen, either of which makes no sense. Second, why can't the phone just unlock with Face ID instead of the user having to swipe up after unlocking...touch ID is so easy...all you do is touch the home button and you unlock the phone and it goes to the home screen, or last app. Why can't face ID do this? Third, the app switching. Why must you swipe up and hold (or even swipe up and over), and then hit the red subtract button to get rid of apps? It is so much better to just swipe up and close apps. Apple should not have changed that. well, there's my thoughts"

Even the $500 OnePlus phones support fast charging out of the box.  My 2 year old Nexus 6P which cost $550 when I got it supported fast charging out of the box.

Well I'm typing this on a Macbook, it just comes across that they are playing catchup, the 10 is called the X to be WOW its new Extra things, which to be fair it has. The Face Recognition looks pretty good My s8 works but its not brilliant. Wireless charging well I had that on my Nexus 4 (when was that? 2014?)  not overly armoured by that selling point, fast charging well had that since the S6 which was 2015? I'm happy for all those apple users that they now have a phone that packs everyday features but its gonna cost them \u00a31200 for the privilege. Apple where once the shining light of quality and performance, but Android and its protagonists have very much caught up. There is still the Android premium gap in the market I think essential tried to fill it but not with the PH-1. I think Samsung could potentially fill as their quality has improved 10 fold but it they wont let go f the S brand. Could the premium come from China? I'm fully expecting the Mi7 from Xiaomi to be a very elegant phone and I'm very much looking forward to that and thats not to mention the 5T that arrived yesterday.\n\nIts the Form Factor The Iphone/S8 size is the premium Market - Small but packs a huge punch.

N/A,2017-11-16T22:14:10.000Z,timbartalex,N/A,"I am an apple geek, but I have to say this phone doesn't impress me much. I like the design, a mix of the various iPhones, well done, but I can't see a so dramatic change between OLED and LCD retina for now. It is better but not to justified the price. I don't mind too much about the notch until you want to watch a video, then the screen becomes same as a normal iphone 7 or 8. They need to work on it. When you move the iPhone X around you can see the oled screen is a bit bluish like lot of reviewers said already and this is not the best. I like the new gestures which replace the home button. But in general I have to say, I won't change my iPhone 7plus with the X for now. It is just a bigger iPhone 8 with better screen and slightly better camera then a 8plus(the stabilizer in the telephoto lens is not that great). I prefer reading and watching videos with the plus and as well if the X camera is much better when you take videos with it the camera app looks small like in the iPhone 8, much much better to have the plus as viewfinder. Surfing internet, reading through an app, watching videos, all of those actions still look better in the plus to me, the X don't take advantages of the \larger\ (maybe just longer) screen. I will wait September to see the X plus 6.5inch, 6.1 and the 6.1 LED, if the rumors are true those are more interesting. This X looks like the iPhone 2 before the release of the 3, an experiment before the right one... doesn't worth 1000$ for me, much better the combo iPhone 8plus+iWatch 3+airpods. The last 2 are the best apple products until now (waiting for the iMac pro...)."

N/A,2017-11-16T22:11:38.000Z,Rodrigo Pelissier,N/A,"You people say Apple fans are blind to subjective preferences, yet most Android fans seem to be blind to actual and provable facts. Apple has been, for instance,  years ahead of the competition with processors since the iPhone 5s came out, 4 years ago; yet you talk about specs, as if having more RAM or an extra MP would make your experience that much better (or at all, for that matter). I bet you people barely even know what a CPU is, or what makes it better or worse than others; have you ever at least read AnandTech\u2019s reviews of iPhones\u2019 CPUs and shit? Yeah, I didn\u2019t think so\u2026 And I won\u2019t even get into Apple\u2019s new custom-designed GPU\u2026 You\u2019re gonna tell me you don\u2019t need that much power on a phone, now? Then, why the fuck would you need fucking 4\u20138 GBs of RAM on one! Basically, you don\u2019t give a shit about specs when the iPhone\u2019s winning, but specs are all that matter to you when Android phones have the lead? What kind of fucked up logic is that? I can\u2019t even believe this shit\u2026\n\nAnd yeah, Samsung and others might've incorporated various features before Apple did, so what? Just compare Samsung\u2019s facial recognition system to the iPhone X\u2019s one; how could anybody possibly, even, fucking ever prefer to have something half-baked and defective a little before, than having something that actually works and makes your experience better, a little later? You gotta be fucking kidding me\u2026 Yeah, Apple clearly rushed iOS 11 as well and I hate that they did it; but it still runs fucking circles around the competition. I didn\u2019t even give a shit about smartphones or computers before knowing Apple (yeah, I hated Windows before even knowing Apple existed); but Apple made technology magical and enjoyable for me, among other things; and if it weren\u2019t for Apple, I would now be studying fucking linguistics instead of software engineering.\n\nStill, the biggest \u201cadvantage\u201d I see in Android would be its customizability, but wtf do I care about that? I don\u2019t even change the wallpaper nor the icons\u2019 position on my iPhone, so I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t change a fucking thing. Meanwhile, I\u2019d suffer every single day from its lagginess, user-hostility, I would miss my favorite games and apps that are exclusive to iOS (the highest-end games and most professional apps for programmers and developers), and I\u2019d lose all magic connection with my MacBook (and I\u2019ll die before going back to that fucking nightmare called Windows); so, why would I ever switch? And\u2026 how could anyone ever say the iPhone\u2019s behind? Because Galaxies got features nobody uses, and cuz it had a gimmicky and shitty facial recognition from before? Or is it cuz it\u2019s got some extra GBs or RAM I literally wouldn\u2019t even notice? I don\u2019t really like iPhone X, btw; and I\u2019m not even trynna defend Apple so much, as I\u2019m honestly flummoxed by Apple haters/Android fans\u2019 incoherence (and boy, do I fucking hate incoherence). If you\u2019re a special kind of user, and for whatever reason the competition offers you something that Apple surprisingly doesn\u2019t, then you might just be a different kind of user with different needs; but if you stupidly claim the iPhone\u2019s objectively behind when facts prove otherwise, and you talk nonsensical shit about Apple without even knowing wtf you\u2019re talking about, then you put the fucking \u201cretard\u201d in \u201cretarded\u201d, and it\u2019s fucking pathetic and infuriating. I\u2019d still prefer Apple if they were behind, and in some way, I would respect if you did the same; but I\u2019d like it for real, actual reasons, instead of making up shitty alternative facts (yeah, I just said that:p)."

I had the 6/6S/7S but it was time to go back to Android Even though im not a fan of Samsung touchwiz I wish Samsung would use a more stock Android os personally I feel it is still better than IOS 11. In my opinion ANDROID os has been better than IOS for a few years now and is getting even better.

Also, if people are still mad about the headphone jack, I understand. My thought is, if you want to watch videos with headphones, use the adapter or earbuds. If you want to charge your phone and listen to music, put your damn phone down. The price is high, but so is the Note 8. And plus, what did you expect from Apple. Rather than hating on this phone, leave it alone. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t like it. If you like it, then like it! But don\u2019t go hating on the phone that you don\u2019t like, just forget it. Also, Face ID. It may be slower than Touch ID, but it does a good job.

The notch was ugly even when they finally revealed it, but seeing people use it, kinda brilliant, with a case on that\u2019s the only unique identifier to it. Saw a mate 10pro the other day, looks like a note 8, saw a note 8 tot it was s8, saw the x with a case on, definitely an x and with a case= no bezels.

N/A,2017-11-16T05:48:39.000Z,smashbro5,N/A,"It's not the visuals of the notch approach per se, it's that it makes the effective screen size smaller than it really is. Yes some apps can wrap around it in portrait orientation, but can't get around videos (and games?) in landscape. That goes for any manufacturer."

N/A,2017-11-16T05:40:57.000Z,Razvan Rogoz,N/A,"Look ... I don't own it but I've owned three iPhones so far and I've played with it at the Apple Store.\n\n\n\n\nI don't believe it's worth it. I don't want to compare it to an Android because the last time I've used Android was four years ago.\n\n\n\n\nI just find it too expensive compared to the iPhone 8 or especially to the new price for the iPhone 7. Yes, it has gestures but so has BlackBerry. Personally I like the home button and the satisfying feedback it offers. I like the finger print sensor. I don't want to use gestures for everything as that's how the BlackBerry Passport worked and they're a pain in the ass to use when your fingers are wet and it misinterprets input.\n\n\n\n\nThe camera and everything may be great but it is $1000! You can get three iPhones 6 with this money, new. You can get two iPhones 7 used. It's $300 more expensive than the new iPhone 8 and brings just the Face ID and the new screen. Sorry but while technically is impressive, this is hardly value for money.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI find more value for money in the 12.9 iPad + keyboard (that's cheaper btw) than in this phone. These are not phones anymore. These are fashion statements. These are in the same category as a watch or a pair of good shoes. From the entire line-up, I'm starting to find the iPhone the least useful device. The iPad can be used as a laptop replacement. The MacBook is still a workhorse for getting things done. The iPhone was great, at $600, not at $1000.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe only good thing about the iPhone X is that the price of the old iPhones dropped or are going to drop significantly."

The Note8's display can only reach 1240 nits for a very small portion of the display, and only under extremely high ambient lighting conditions.

New notch only 40% of original iPhone X notch size.  iPhone XI plus models introduced with an array of new colors.\n\niPhone XII: Receiver & camera moved up slightly to minimize notch size to include nearly just the receiver and camera. New notch size a mere 20% to that of the original iPhone X notch.\n\niPhone XIII: Receiver moves up to top of iPhone and camera is now covered by screen. When front camera is enabled, a black spot appears revealing camera underneath and reducing light interference with front camera pictures.\n\niPhone XIV: Full \u201cinfinity\u201d edge-to-edge display with no notch as in previous iPhone. First true \u201call screen\u201d iPhone. It\u2019ll be so groundbreaking to Apple standards that they\u2019ll probably just skip over iPhone 14 and go straight to iPhone XV or go with a new name like iPhone \u221e."

N/A,2017-11-16T04:35:15.000Z,Neil W,N/A,"Touch ID is indeed faster than Face ID when you compare the sheer speed, but in real life experience, Face ID is a lot more intuitive and practically more than makes up for  the slower process. For example, most of the time if not all, you don\u2019t unlock the phone right away till after you turn on the screen and check if there\u2019s new notifications, so with Face ID by the time you\u2019ve done checking, the phone is already done unlocking. Better yet, you can get right into the specific notification by tapping it since the phone is already unlocked VS having the extra step to unlock the phone on a Touch ID phone before you can launch the specific modification. As for the gestures, I\u2019ve always made my phones work just like that whenever I was able to jailbreak or root in the past. It becomes a second nature in literally no time and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it. Once go gestures, never go back."

N/A,2017-11-16T04:21:27.000Z,E M,N/A,"So I went to an Apple store and compared my brand new 8 Plus to the X. \nThe X like all Oled screen phones gives you a feeling of content being very close (on top of the) screen. 8 Plus has it's content a little deeper below the LCD screen, if that makes sense. Other than that, the 8 Plus sounds better, has a better battery life, has a larger usable screen ( though just a tiny bit less bright), \u00a0it works in landscape mode and has NO notch. I think 8 Plus is the best iPhone ever made and it has the best LCD screen EVER on any phone since cell phone exist. Period!\n\niPhone X is NEW but not the best.

I don't mean that in a snobby way, I've never actually seen a 120Hz display. I just mean that it would have to be THAT BIG a jump from the current orthodoxy for me to give it to them. With Razer pulling that out on their first phone ever, Apple is going to have to do some real work competing.\n\nCan I also say that I loved how creative you got with this video? It's like a documentary. The part where you mention the notch by talking through the display as you hold the phone, and the Animoji section where you speak through them...both very clever ways to keep us engaged while being informative. Looking forward to more cool stuff like that soon, hopefully! Keep up the amazing videos. If only I had a 4K display to soak in that crisp detail even more."

The 64gb was designed to push people toward the bigger, more expensive 256gb model. More crapple douchebaggery in effect.

Everyone probably unlocks their phone millions times. And yes touch ID isn't exactly 100% authenticate but as you mentioned if touch ID is at 99%, Face ID would be 95%. Getting confused with IR radiations from the sun and back light environments and adding to it the extra work you have to do every time you unlock. Any time Touch ID is better than Face ID. And also with all the ML face recognition stuff it wouldn't get close to Touch ID any time soon."

And LG even put ESS Sabre (hi-fi audio) DAC and powerful hi-fi Amp connected to 3,5 mm Jack into the V30 while having even better water and mil-spec shock and drop resistance (and while the connector is disappearing from smartphones, it is the death of quality audio on smartphones, rather than the death of headphone Jack as it is popular to say, completely ignoring the fact, that phones are MINORITY MARKET for headphone manufacturers, especially those in pro audio). \nAnd this is the best smartphone to convert to from Blackberry, since the OS is copy of BlackBerry OS10.

Android fanboys are so damn annoying, I stg \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f smh. Go watch the Note 8/S8/G6/V30/Pixel 2 review if you like that shit so much! Nobody asked you to come here \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Fuck off with that annoying shit, you're just wasting your finger strength. It's the consumer's choice if they wanna buy a $1000 phone. It's their money. So stay the hell out of their wallet. I personally like this phone a lot. Apple has really stepped up their game now. And just because it has that \Animoji feature\, doesn't mean it's an EMOJI MACHINE. Uneducated fanboys have been saying that shit ever since they heard about the feature, just to talk shit. And Apple didn't pay him dumbasses. It was actually his honest opinion. If it was an Android, would you say the same thing? Damn, Android fans are dumb as hell. You guys do realize there's more features than just that? Lol. I like iPhones better than Android phones because they're faster, don't lag as much, and have way better optimization.

The Samsung Galaxy Note8 can produce up to 1,240 nits, but only for small portions of the screen area (Low Average Picture Levels) \u2013 for Full Screen Brightness the Note8 can produce up to 423 nits with Manual Brightness\\n\nHe said FaceID has trouble in sunlight...this isn't really true, but he said it as if it's a fact.

Just a side note about the use of Animoji on other iPhone: the Animoji feature does make use of the TrueDepth camera some of the time. Specifically, the phone uses the TrueDepth camera periodically to make a map of the user\u2019s face, especially on start up. It then uses the standard RGB front-facing camera to track the user\u2019s face in real-time, enabling the Animoji feature.

I jumped the Android ship when the only way to get a flagship phone was to buy one with a jumbo screen. And remember the days when carriers packed bloat wear on Android. I know Apple never let the crap happen. Or the great old days when Android needed to be updated and you had to check the carrier and then the mfg to see if it was on the upgrade list... no thanks. Samsung LG and all the other Android mfgs make great phones... for someone else.

N/A,2017-11-15T18:50:01.000Z,Orlando_246,N/A,I'm not an apple fan but for the love of God the notch is not that noticeable. My main problems with this phone is the removal of the touch id and the bogus excuse from Apple for removing it and the price. The faceID is a cool feature but it's not that practical. Along with the new gestures that are a bit annoying and the new button mapping. Seriously apple I have to press two buttons to turn off my phone. In my opinion the phone is not as polished as I was expecting. Especially from a $1000+ device it's just not worth it at this point.

N/A,2017-11-15T18:36:17.000Z,James Harmon,N/A,"I\u2019m a longtime iPhone user (since 3GS). Other than full screen, I don\u2019t see much new design-wise from my 6s. Apple was late to the full-screen party  and only came after the success of other brands. This review also makes too many excuses for iOS shortcomings, dismissing them with, \u201cWell, that\u2019s Apple.\u201d No, that\u2019s actually Apple being arrogant. Sure, the hardware chips and camera may be better than, say, the Note 8, but it was released 6 months later. Similarly, the Note 9 designers will be able to \u201cadjust\u201d for the X\u2019s features. And speaking of \u201cfeatures,\u201d Animojis is not one; those who think it is need to get a life; at best, it\u2019s a novelty, and certainly not one to justify buying an X. Overall, i found the X boring; this is the first time I\u2019m not \u201cupgrading\u201d to a new iPhone after one or two years. The X may, indeed, be the best iPhone yet, but it\u2019s far, far from being perfect, and note that he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best smartphone. I\u2019m waiting to see what comes out next year, from all brands. Given Apple\u2019s track record of recent years, I expect the XI (or whatever it\u2019s called) to be incrementally \u2014 but only incrementally \u2014  better, but still staid. And, FYI and FWIW, I\u2019m 70."

No wire to limit your moves at the gym or when simply listening to music, most cars are now Bluetooth standard equipped. And for the gestures and swiping with the finger, i like it better than than a home button, feels more natural. This phone is great, the only thing for me is the price tag although I got it the first day and was very sceptic about it. It was going to be the first iPhone I wasn\u2019t going to get on release day, but I did and I immediately love it. I think now, its worth it. The camera was what sold me at the end."

It\u2019s a lot easier.\n\nI find the glass is amazing on the iPhone. It\u2019s always smooth to the touch. Other than Samsung phones, I don't think I've used any other phone that has an amazing glass when touching and interacting with the display. Disregarding the resolution and numbers. The actual quality of the screen and glass is crazy good. Things look a little cinematic. I find Samsung phones have a similar feeling on their displays. And I do understand they\u2019re the manufactured by Samsung. So it only makes sense. \n\nThe stainless steel looks distracting and chrome like on the silver one. I\u2019m glad I went with the slate.\n\nI also find it weird the camera is on the right side instead of the left or at least centered. I cover it up and put smudges on it naturally because I\u2019m right-handed. So when I pick it up or put it down my fingers are on it. Not a big deal. Just something I notice. \n\nWhen it comes to the notch, I like it to be honest. I like the smaller one on the Essential too. It looks futuristic to me. It\u2019s different from what we\u2019re used to. \n\nI do find that the iPhone handles notifications poorly imo compared to Android. I can check the notification in the app and that same notification will still be on the notification page. If the notification is many minutes old then you can dismiss them all with the X. Otherwise, there is no clear or dismiss button. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought it was a bit dumb to keep most of the settings for apps in a separate settings application. Why can\u2019t we access those dedicated settings for the app within the app we\u2019re using like on Android? Why should we exit out of an app to go to the settings app just to change settings for the app I had to exit out of?\n\nAll in all, I think the phone is pretty sweet.

Why is a Pixel 2 better? Is it better in all ways or in certain scenarios or modes? Be a bit more detailed. \n\nAlso, ever thought that maybe not everyone desires the same as you? I own both a Nexus 6P and an iPhone and I much prefer the notification system on iOS. Maybe not everyone wants them grouped and I would hazard a guess that more people want them as it is than grouped hence why Apple removed grouped notifications from a past iOS. \n\nAnd about Samsung making the screen? Why does this need to be mentioned? Apple has said that they developed and engineered the screen and Samsung has made it to their specification. And nevertheless, you don\u2019t mention TSMC as the chip manufacturer or any other contracted manufacturer. So just stop that. \n\nOtherwise, good review. Agree on TouchID. It would\u2019ve been nicer if both options were present. But I love the passiveness of FaceID."

There is no reason to omit a headphone jack whatsoever. \It prompted people to use wireless which is better\  People will use what is best for them. A choice is always better. \Its 2017 use wireless.\ the use of the year as a reason is utterly retarded. I have a pair of wireless headphones that are higher quality than my wired ones, but I prefer the wired because of the simplicity of not having to charge them or turn them on. It's like making you only use wireless charging because \wireless charging is better and it's 2017 come on\ It also amuses me how people are mad that he congratulated Samsung on the display they made. Why is it wrong for him to congratulate a manufacturer on their display? This phone is Apple's attempt to finally catch up to Android, and add a feature or two instead or removing them like they did with the iPhone 7. I don't dislike the notch because it's a 2 by 1 aspect ratio so it doesn't matter most of the time. I think Apple did well on the design of this phone and it seems they are trying to regain their standing, but the price tag firmly cements Apple into a market of poor sheep who waste their money on Apple products and rich snobs who brag that they have them."

Why this change of heart suddenly? What I find absolutely weird is that despite the negatives/downsides such as complete glass back (You break and without insurance you pay $399 out of pocket), a notch on the screen that hampers a full screen viewing experience, face recognition being accurate 95% of the time and a camera that is not as great as the pixel 2's machine learning experience, you call this the best yet. In my opinion, it might be best among the other iPhones but by no means this is better than the other available flagship phones. All I see is Apple trying to squeeze the  buyers pockets by forcing you to have an insurance for this delicate glass back of $240 for the entire period of usage, extra for the 256 GB storage option, buy extra wires and plugs for fast charging. I think these were worth mentioning in your review. Like the iPhone X your review was half baked."

N/A,2017-11-15T13:47:31.000Z,B V,N/A,"I think to me the price is a huge sticking point for stuff that is available already and for stuff that isn't absolutely honed. We used to think paying \u00a3300 for a phone was insane. This tech is now less user friendly with the swipe gestures, the test was whether an elderly person could easily use it. I dunno, I've had iPhones for a while and used to be pumped for each one... This one and back to the 6s all don't do anything for me... they all seem very basic changes or ones that benefit apple but not me. The design of the overall phone is dated, the notch is not actually improving the phone as it actually cuts into things. The last few iPhones have pushed me to no looking at Android's highend market for my phone. I love tech, I buy all sorts of tech just to see how good it is, but the iPhone is almost predictable as soon as you see what features it will have, there isn't a WOW factor to the phones, it's more of a \what? why would they do that?\ factor. for a \u00a31000, it's a little too steep, that's a massive proportion of my pay... for that, I expect a perfect user experience, I use my phone for videos and photos a lot. I've bought phones on their usability, their camera, their screens and their wow factor. This misses the mark on that (for me). The animoji are a gimmick that anyone could do on any phone, it's just they hyped this up to sound like it was new tech, it just smells of \let's just pack it with random stuff that do things...\ I'm an apple fan and android, but apple just don't have that flair that they used to have, where each phone seemed like a step into the unknown. The tech is no longer leading edge, it's \that'll do\ Face ID is not a logical solution, it's just the one that allowed them to get no bezels. I'm one person with my views, others will love it and buy it, I just hope that this doesn't set a precedent for the average phone cost going up to \u00a31,000, which will in turn make our phone contracts worth a lot more. It's insane that we used to think it was expensive to pay \u00a310 a month 10 years ago(Now I feel old) and \u00a325 sounds cheap now. people regularly pay \u00a330-\u00a350... there are other factors too, but I'm questioning when it will be that we realise these contracts are making us pay through our nose for something that actually doesn't cost that much to run. I hope we see quality products at reasonable prices back on the shelves soon. An iPhone 5 at the time of production cost about \u00a350-\u00a380 to produce and they've all been around that price since. I know this as I've studied Product Design and our Lecturer worked through getting one put together as if he was Apple, there are design costs too but with the sales of the phone, they become extremely small. So after all the costs surrounding designing, making, distributing, sales, they were making anything from 150% to 300% markup... I don't think it should be free phones, I understand they need to make a profit, but the price hikes are huge, but what we are receiving is actually not that proportion better. Moore's Law says that tech halves in price or doubles in speed or quality every 2 years (now closer to 2 and a half) This should mean that iPhones get cheaper overall or not go up in price much.\nLong rant over.\nLove the vids, please keep going, I'm a total tech lover, and iPhone or not, it's your money, your life, enjoy whatever tech you have!"

N/A,2017-11-15T12:09:00.000Z,Reginald Ramirez,N/A,"Nice you pointed out that you don't need the 3D sensor for the Animoji. Didn't see any reviewers point that out. And it's the same thing with swipe-left/right at bottom to switch apps. Other iPhones can do that if it was programmed in the software. --\u00a0That Apple restricts some features/possibilities within the software to make their flagship \more\ special is just disappointing.\u00a0\n\nI've always used iPhone since 3GS model. I love iPhones (having owned also 4, 6 plus, and now SE), and mostly the reason of why I've been sticking to it is the ecosystem (together with iPad and Macs). Besides, upgrading to 4 was worth it (retina and front camera). Upgrading to 6 plus was worth it (bigger screen+battery finally). Buying SE (missed smaller sized phone). And now, I miss the bigger screen and planning to upgrade, but so far I'm not convinced if X is worth it.\u00a0\n\nIs Animoji worth the extra cost? For me personally, No. Sure it's fun to have, but I don't need that.. Is Face ID worth the extra cost? Maybe it's more convenient, but like mentioned in the review, Touch ID works the same if not better and I don't mind using a finger to unlock the phone.\u00a0\n\nSure I could go for the 8 or 8 plus, but the design though with the same huge bezels. After all I pointed out, the ONLY reason for me to still buy an iPhone for my next phone is the ecosystem it is part of. Which leaves me the question: Do I really need a phone that is part of that ecosystem? I often use my phone to edit documents on iCloud, and I have headphones that take advantage of the W1 chip. Are these two features worth sacrificing for a new exciting experience with an Android-phone, or should I go for the 8/X that doesn't really offer any changes I have use for?"

They have the notch cos they could not figure out the fingerprint beneath the glass stuff and now claim FaceID is more secure than FingerPrintID, which is totally false. The Face ID has been fooled by multiple pairs of twins... but we all know that even the most identical of twins do not have the same fingerprint. So how are the odds of the FaceID less than that of the Fingerprint ID? Apple should get rid of the notch and make the fingerprint work beneath the glass. They may also keep the FaceID as long a they can make it work through the glass so that there is no need for the notch."

He did not mention how to close apps in multi tasking, it doesn\u2019t close properly by the swipe up.The way to do it is silly , not user friendly , not apple way at all. Steve jobs would have fired the guy who did that. \n\n Apps freeze a lot. Face ID is not bad but it\u2019s definitely not as good as Touch ID. What problem did it exactly solve ?\nThis phone is not worth its price tag in anyway. Apple had to catch up to the trend of bezel less displays and they rushed next years Phone and its very apparent. \n\nNot making allegations but reviewers do not want to piss Apple or they lose a lot of future privileges with invitation, launch and so on. Take any Apple reviews from major players with a grain of Salt. \n\nIf you really want to get this phone you have to wait atleast another 6 months or better yet,  just skip this generation. The only time I am considering to skip a new Iphone is going to be this year. \n\nFor the first time in years I am missing Steve jobs running Apple. Cook is just there to please shareholders, not a perfectionist or a visionary like Steve.\n\nWhat phones need right now is solution to common problems like battery life without increasing weight or thickness,  and durability, because phones get dropped all the time. Making it more user friendly and fixing AI assistants that are still dumb should also be worked upon. No one is solving these problems at all. Not even seeing it !"

N/A,2017-11-15T10:01:39.000Z,R X,N/A,"I think Apple has done well. \n\nI think the notifications needs cleaning up as you say. \n\nI think Apple needs to introduce auto unlock once Face ID knows it you. \n\nApple should also include fast charging in the box. \n\nI love Air Pods and would a discount on them for buying the iPhone X. \n\nThe Notch is fine but eventually I think this will be gone as well. \n\nPersonally I\u2019ve always preferred a Plus Model. \n\nI think next year will be even better. \n\nI also think Face ID will get faster next year. \n\nFace ID could also use gyroscopes to tilt when it\u2019s flat on a table. This could perhaps allow the phone to look for you at a more shallow angle. \n\nSo it\u2019s a good move from Apple. \n\nI think the real pace is still being set by Samsung. If Samsung brings out the S9 at \u00a3900 with a better package than the iPhone X. Apple will have to react. \n\nMany people still think the S8 Plus and Note 8 is better than the iPhone X. \n\nApple therefore has a good design now and a future look for the next couple of years. \n\nApple will have to bring down its cost. This isn\u2019t because Apple wants to be more cheap. This is purely because the S9 will out to grab as many Apple users as possible. \n\nIf you look through the comments, you will notice the Samsung, Google and LG have great phones out as well. \n\nCompetition is based on performance and price. \n\nApple can\u2019t sell phones which are \u00a3230 more expensive than Samsung\u2019s flagship. This is literally suicide as Samsung will Just grab more and more customers."

IT'S SMALLER...\ No, dude, not only is it freaking cropped, but there's a goddamned notch clipping the video ON ONE SIDE, this is so far below what Apple claims to stand for, that any attempt to justify it is so disgustingly and obviously fan boyish, it's just gross. I can't believe you justified the notch, and the CROPPING of your videos, by saying, 'Oh, by being able to see the whole video (that I put time and effort into) it's like it's on a smaller screen...', pathetic! Be objective!!! That is what you are paid for! That being said, I am an Apple fan of 30 years, but this nonsense in inexcusable!"
N/A,2017-11-15T09:54:56.000Z,TheSupremeSkill,N/A,"I would pay something like 700 \u20ac for this, since Galaxy S8 is already widely available for 600 \u20ac in Europe. S8 has 3,5 mm jack, no notch, arguably a better screen, fingerprint sensor, no wobling on a flat surface and such refinements.\n\nIf you compare X to Note 8 you will get the pen and larger and better screen. Not that I accept the atrocious price of Note 8, but still.\n\nSo given the price, which you cannot ignore, this phone is one of the worst releases in mobile phone history and I cannot believe people are buying this and telling themselves this phone is even decent. \n\nOf course I myself could release a new phone which is a tad better in every category than this - and those phones already exist - then put on a price tag of 1600 \u20ac and get raving reviews, but that one would still suck because it offers so little for a critically high price.\n\nReviewers should stomp this phone to the ground, but yet I hear much praise. This is only because of the status that Apple still currenly owns, but only a fool would buy X for just that status."

N/A,2017-11-15T08:32:30.000Z,Philosophies of Travel,N/A,A good review for a very specific group of people who live in a world where Iphones are the only phones one can buy. You would want to hope its the 'best iphone yet' this puppy starts at $1579 in Australia. Thats a good $200 more than the note 8 is worth and  $500 more than the samsung s8.... Id love to hear your opinion on how much extra $$ running IOS is worth and whether or not apple is taking advantage of a nuts amount of brand loyalty it seems to have built over the years.

You put glossy glass, ceramic on a mobile phone, call it premium, users pay premium for that, then they buy a Dbrand matte skin to make it look like their previous, more grip-able, non-glossy, more practical metal phones, classic.\n\nIn any case, the phone is good, display is fantastic, camera is actually comparable with Pixel 2, people just prefer the Pixel 2 for boosted colours, though it does have a pretty much better front facing camera anyway, but still X's camera is excellent. If one can digest iOS, and no problem with the price tag then I don't see how this is not the best phone of 2017, especially when Pixel 2 has all those quality control issues anyway. \n\nAnd ROFLMAO at all the Samsung users commenting here. A Samsung Galaxy phone is exactly the opposite experience of an iPhone or a Pixel, so your Note 8s or S8s remain a comical thing still, best of luck with that."

N/A,2017-11-15T07:11:31.000Z,enzmondo,N/A,"No one really explained why they don\u2019t notice the notch when they use the phone. I have a theory: no one really does look at the status bar constantly. All the focus goes to the middle of the screen. It\u2019s also scientifically proven that the moment a person sees something new, their initial focus is all in the middle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for some people to realise the big picture or their minds choose to see one thing when the whole thing is the correct perception. Going back to the notch, your focus stays in the middle of the screen. The only time you\u2019d notice the notch is when you are deliberately looking for something in the status bar. Be it time, battery, or network connection, you still don\u2019t look at those things constantly. That\u2019s why the notch seems to \u201cdisappear\u201d in use. Obviously, the notch doesn\u2019t literally disappear, but rather, our minds choose not to see the notch on top. That\u2019s why the notch is not a problem at all. If you come to think about it, the notch and ears are just merely extensions of the new screen. Don\u2019t think of it as a lose, but as a gain. You get extra screen on top, which can be used for then new status bar."

I'm sorry I don't agree. Don't make bad, inconvenient design decisions to accomodate other things that might not even be as important to other people. Instead improve your research and design to get everything to work without losing important functionality. That is the true test of good design, and why I'm sticking with Samsung for now. I don't have to deal with a notch, or lose a headphone jack, or lose screen real estate, or lose speed, functionality or good features, nor lose water proofing, good hardware design, finger print scanning, battery life, sd card slots or anything else. They've just nailed it all. THAT is good design. Pushing boundaries without making big compromises."

Dot projector with software marks the vital points of your face for expressions and then reads it live as we make expressions. No experience holding an iPhone X.

What happened to consumer interest? What about whether or not a feature would bode better or not with certain groups? You didn't mention any of that and instead replaced it all with \just get over it\. Why? \n\nNot only that, but what happened to all those \iPhone just works and is easier to use\ ? A messy notification \just works\ ? Having to dab into the settings for camera control \just works\ ? Turning off Bluetooth and WiFi, but they're still on and now Apple has to have a message letting users know is considered as \still works\ ?

N/A,2017-11-15T06:04:43.000Z,Brandon Banner,N/A,"I have the iPhone X, and you mentioned that watching video with the notch cuts off some content. But usually the content is near the middle of the display not the corner and if it is it appears it\u2019s not all gone. I just watched this video in full screen and it was perfect. Also I completely agree with you about things like the notch, or lack of headphone jack. If you\u2019re buying this phone you\u2019re not still upset about these things. PEOPLE: the notch isn\u2019t a big deal (chill out) it\u2019s not in the way (unless it\u2019s fullscreen, but even still not really in the way) and the headphone jack is gone get over it and go wireless oh well, and it being glass well it adds features and it looks and feels super amazing. So if you don\u2019t like modernness then don\u2019t buy it. But if you\u2019re the person looking for the most up to date and aren\u2019t afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone, into what will be your new comfort zone you\u2019ll never regret it."

N/A,2017-11-15T05:46:00.000Z,Nathan Jolly,N/A,"I like the iPhone X! I got to put my hands on one at Best Buy. I took to the home gesture immediately, but I couldn't get the \pick up and toss\ app switcher gesture. All in all it's a great iPhone. But, my 6s is still going strong, so I'm going to hold onto that. My 6s is my first ever iPhone after 6 years of Android phones, and while I miss some of Android's extra features, I like the stability of iOS. I have never had an Android phone not shit the bed after 12-18 months. It's just what Android does, it collapses under its own weight and bloat. A factory reset usually sorts it for a while, but then it's not gonna go another 12-18 months, more like 3-4 if you're lucky. I'm constantly blown away that my iPhone continues to be good. And I'm still blown away that having an icon below or to the right of a blank space is so hard for Apple. For a smartphone, particularly a big one, screen content should flow from the bottom to the top from user operated controls to content that is merely meant to be viewed. If I'm meant to interact with it, it should be closer to the bottom. If I'm not, push it to the top. So naturally I want my icons along the bottom, but not so much along the top."

Honestly, the OS design gets boring. \n\nThe iPhone X has a beautiful design in my opinion and a nice camera, but that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t think this is a phone that\u2019s worth my time. I have an iPhone 6s, and I know other people with the 7 and 8 and I can say that those are the same exact phones just with better cameras and no headphone jacks. The iPhone X is no exception, and at that it has a worse camera compared to the 8. It\u2019s got a big screen, but that\u2019s it. (And Face ID which is apparently a lot slower than fingerprint) \n\nApple\u2019s lack of innovation is honestly pushing me back to Android. Perhaps the Pixel?"

N/A,2017-11-15T05:40:58.000Z,BcsDaBomb,N/A,I\u2019m pretty positive that Anemoji uses the sensors but does require a full facial recognition to work. I\u2019m also pretty sure this is how the verge got the video you showed because that how I did it. If you do it with the lock screen it\u2019s so fast you miss it. Good catch though.
N/A,2017-11-15T05:40:58.000Z,pinky1900's,N/A,I would personally go with the 8 Plus simply because the home button. (Yes cheaper too) but I like the finger print security over the other methods.

I'm not sure whether Apple actively encouraged that perception so that they didn't cop flack for not making them available to other iPhone users but I guess the cat's out of the bag.\n\nI also have to say, while animojis may be a lot of fun initially, I can't see most adults remaining enamoured with them for too long. They may be great for kids, but the shine will wear off pretty quickly for most people. To be honest, I'm thinking that the sort of person for which that wouldn't happen is probably not the sort of person I want to spend all that much time with anyway."

I know they are kind of in two different ballparks but I'm interested in your thoughts. I am an android user and have been using Nexus devices and Pixel devices since the Nexus 4, but I really like the design of the iPhone X and I was thinking about giving it a try. If I did switch Google Now and Google Assistant would be what I miss most. I know you can get them on iPhone, but they just work better on Android."

Even criticism is kind of sugar coated.\n\nI'm considering the iPhone X for my mom, but I've come across the following criticisms (read on reddit) which unfortunately neither you, nor others have even touched.\n\n1. The insane repair cost of front/back panel.\n\n2. The turtle-slow wireless charging and slow fast charging (saw mrwhoseyourboss's video) and the exclusion of fast charging.\n\n3. The strategy to sell 256 GB by not offering 128 GB. Should be informed imo, coz well, with 4k @ 60 fps, we all know how easy it is to full your storage. \n\n4. The bugs in iOS 11 which makes it seem like a beta, which makes the phone slower than the Android flagships. (A lot of discussions over reddit on this)\n\n5. A word on comparison between the amoled of the X and the one on the Samsungs.\n\n6. Whether the 8 plus makes more sense over the X. \n\nI know there's an intangible force  that doesn't allow YouTubers to be hyper-critical of the iPhones, but these ought to be covered. Unfortunately, I was hearing the same stuff what I've heard a million times over. The good."

If they don't have Apple CarPlay, they might end up trying to face unlock they're iPhone Xs while driving. That's even worse than just picking up your phone and looking at it for a brief second, FaceID takes a couple more brief seconds. First of all, don't even touch your phone while driving, it isn't and will never be worth it......well I don't know what the future beholds so I can't exactly say never, but you get the point."

I would much rather see the Android style approach here with a fingerprint sensor on the back and an on-screen set of navigation buttons. The gesture approach is just very off-putting for long term iOS users (or new users) and the lack of Touch ID is a deterrent for people who truly love Touch ID. I'll be getting the iPhone 8+ this  time around. Same benchmarks, better overall phone. So what if it's \an iPhone 7s.\ Touch ID is too integral to the iPhone to just throw it away like this. When I was getting my iPhone 7+ there was an older gentleman next to me setting up his iPhone 6s+. How do you think he would do trying to set up the iPhone X for the first time?

So maybe next year we'll get iPhone 9, 9 Plus, and X2? But then again, X is 'ten' so it wouldn't make sense to do that anymore afterwards so maybe next year it'll just be an X2 and X2 Plus?\n\nI like how the X is finally using OLED and has HDR.\n\nI also hope that Apple will have a 'Close All App' function eventually. Maybe it's just me, but I always rapidly swipe up to close apps 1 by 1 and that gets a little tedious sometimes.\nIt would also be nice if iPhones had expandable storage and also swapped to USB-C.\nI heard that Face ID has issues with those things as well as identical twins being able to unlock it.\n\nOh and it would've been nice if the iPhone had an optional, software enabled home button like the Galaxy phones.\n\nRegardless of what phone you buy, you're going to be spending a lot of money so you might a well get a good case for like $30 ~ $50.

Swiping is slower and less convenient than tapping, and Face ID is slower and less convenient than Touch ID. Even if the speed and accuracy improves, it's still a pain to have to hold your phone up to your face to unlock it. You can unlock phones with fingerprint readers while you're picking them up or taking them out of your pocket...\n\nGetting to the top corners is really tricky on this phone, and the reachability gesture is ironically hard to trigger with one hand. Watching video is flat out bad on this phone because you're either getting massive bezels and a small image, or a notch cutout. iOS is... iOS.\n\nIt does do a lot really well (processor/performance, camera, etc.) but this just isn't worth $1,000. It feels like sacrifices on top of sacrifices as opposed to the most premium experience money can buy. If someone handed me one of these tomorrow I would sell it without a second thought. $1,000 is like 140 burritos (or >150 if we're buying the fast charger, which hilariously isn't included). I guarantee you I would be happier with my current phone and 140 burritos."

As for best mobile phone I believe that is subjective to what you prefer and like, in terms of specs factually sure phones have things over others. Apple does have the fastest and best of processing time all the time, but I don't think that will always be the case.

The iPhone X looks like a phone where Apple was really hesitant to change their design elements and was forced to add something to make the phone look new. Why shift from aluminium backs to glass? Iphones were famous for their all unibody construction. Why go for glass which is really expensive to replace? Wireless charging is not just worth it. Its like 3d Televisions, a completely flop marketing gimmick. The overall design looks bad and feels like Apple has hurried it. Hope apple changes it next year as I\u2019m looking forward to upgrade my iPhone 6s."

I mean, obviously it looks modern and looks cleaner, but bezels to me are treated just the same as the notch here for the iPhone X: I don't notice them. I have a Pixel 2 (non XL). I really wanted to get the XL because of the small bezels, but I hate big phones. Before this, I had an iPhone 6s and I convinced myself that I could get the regular Pixel 2 because, just like Marques mentioned about the notch, I'm not looking at the bezels when I was using the phone. Lo and behold, not once have I complained about the larger bezels on my Pixel because they just kind of melt away. So the $1000 for a bezel-less screen just isn't worth it to me."

Also that notch looks like it would get annoying.\nThinking of upgrading to a Pixel 2 or Razer Phone. Might wait for the new Samsung next year until Apple fixes the X's notch or adds a plus.

N/A,2017-11-15T03:46:08.000Z,Brian Florido,N/A,"Dude...........dude.......... I will first and openly admit, before I get a bunch of apple fans and Android haters, no phone is worth 1000 dollars. The functionality and look hasn't changed since the iPhone 5. I'm talking about color and art design. The cameras while impressive for all phones to fight, is really good. This one is probably just as impressive but man seriously? The price went up for, what to me at least as a over all user, an oled display and now a top firing speaker to run a duel speaker config. And not even good. I'm not even a Samsung fan boy anymore because even then I don't justify the design and other things that are not about this phone right now. While everyone has a right to spend their money on whatever they want and while I am clearly nobody to believe that this phone is useless to anyone except myself, I still can't believe you approved so little about this phone to justify $1000. There seriously has to be a line where enough is enough or this case there isn't enough to justify this price or idea that this is appropriate to the audience. But I digress as I prefer having a verbal conversation or rant about how I feel towards this phone than continue. Plus I am actually curious to see what thoughts and or mean comments I'm going to get for this one comment. Not trying to troll but from someone who expects a lot from an iPhone and apple themselves, I seriously am disappointed in this phone and this review. But maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture. Someone can feel free to educate me a little as even I can be ignorant to the subject. Not a challenge or troll but just seriously wanting to hear a counter argument."

To get 4K 60fps and 1080p 240fps, not to mention a 5.8\u201d OLED viewfinder, you would have to pay a very pretty penny indeed for a DSLR camera. And you would not get one that small.

Why? Because 10% of his beloved fan base are Apple haters and blind android fanboys who are very critical in the comment section and like dislike button. The other 90%  is silent media consuming people who use their brains to analyse things instead of jumping in to the keyboard for a temper tantrum.  Just like everybody else MKBHD is very scared of this 10% and thus continue to trash talk Apple when ever possible. \n\nHe did not bring up the headphone jack problem on the Pixel 2 review but here he did criticized it. He praised Samsung for this display. and bashed Apple for being late to the game but didn't say anything about Pixel 2 xl display defects. Where are those  5 pillars in analyzing a tech product?? He failed to complement enough for the following aspects of the iPhone X such as design, build quality, display, speakers, user interface, Cameras, wireless charging."

If you look at most close up portrait photos taken with a traditional camera and bokeh lens, there is a blur as you get to the ears and around the hairline. It seems like they are trying to mimic this. So I don\u2019t think it is necessarily less capable than the pixel, the software and camera engineers simply made different choices. They definitely  should include an option to adjust the depth of the blur if this is the case... software update?

N/A,2017-11-15T03:16:03.000Z,S w,N/A,Sadly for me the only real dealbreaker after deciding to upgrade from my 5s now was the notch. As someone who watches an absurd amount of videos it really made me quite sad. I personally would have \nchosen to have an extra small bar above the screen instead. Lack of headphone jack is a BIG bummer but I probably would have gone ahead it with it anyway. \n\nIt felt nice in hand and I quite liked it just like I do all my iPads and other devices but it seems this will be the year to switch to android. Oh well looking forward to what the future holds. Currently just awaiting the launch of Oneplus 5t since they do have an headphone jack.

The premium is the new factor. That it does not have competition other than switching ecosystems. Android users can switch phones and manufacturers and still have a similar eco system of apps and familiar usability.
