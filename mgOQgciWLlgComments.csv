Like my iPhone 4, my 6 plus is in mint condition both cosmetically and in functionality. I tuned into your channel because I trust you to provide an honest overview and commentary, and you surely didn't disappoint, my friend. After watching this, I will hang on to my phone for as long as it'll go. It's crazy, I'm looking at my phone and the display and speed of function is still, after 4 bloody years, remarkably fast! The display is solid and the battery life is still great!  I just don't see myself trading my phone in order to upgrade to something that is just slightly better. When I purchased the 6 plus one of the key selling features was that it had the same computing power of putting together thousands of standard computers until it measured the size of Arizona!  The other brag was that it had more computing power than the computers that sent all of the early NASA space missions that went to the moon and orbited space; COMBINED!  How are these still not a good things? You might be right and these phones could be Apple's bread and butter, most tech reviewers seem to think the same thing, but even with this being the consensus, I think that I will just stick with my iPhone 6 Plus until it dies, I lose it, I break it, or I die; which ever comes first!  I do think that there is a good chance that this phone can tank because why would I pay for this phone when the new Samsung gives me just about everything that the 10S Max has at a low price than these new Skittle phones? Well, I might change my my mind when I see it and test it for myself, but I sincerely doubt it. These phones simply cost too much now so Apple is making my decision easier. I don't even think it's a matter of affordability anymore, buying one of these phones, even if you can afford it, just puts one's judgement in question! Anyway, thanks for the review!"""

I understand that 720p seems or rather is a bit low for the price tag that the XR has.. but it's my understanding that Apple has never been about making one feature the best on the market but about making the best product overall that people will LOVE to use. The combination of brilliant features, in my opinion the best OS, strong CPU performance (A12 bionic), great overall quality and design, the list goes on.. That is what makes Apple the company that sells the most loved phone in the world. What's the need for all those extra pixels? Are they really useful or just an attempt to create pseudo-superior phones for a cheaper price? I for one am really impressed with the amount of human eagles out there who claim to see the difference between a 326ppi display and anything that\u2019s above that (on a relatively small screen). Realistically though, a higher resolution only makes sense for VR applications, doesn't it? Apparently the big bad villain Apple has again released an overpriced phone (as always, with too little upgrades). Would you please do a video on this? I'd really appreciate it :) thanks"""

The S9 and the XR are both basically the same price so most people will probably be comparing the two:\n\nXR pro's:\n-Optimisation\n-7nm CPU\n-50% faster GPU\n-4k 60fps recording\n-1080p 60fps front facing video\n-portrait mode with 1 camera with all the extra studio lighting modes too\n-portrait mode also on front facing camera\n-iOS which is key for many buyers\n-will likely see support for 4 years plus\n-larger display\n-face ID\n-Amazing UX\n-COMES IN RED\n\n\nXR con's:\n-No headphone jack\n-Bigger bezel\n-820p at 330ppi\n-LCD\n\nS9 pro's:\n-headphone jack\n-960fps\n-Android key for other buyers\n-more customisable \n-no notch\n-AMOLED \n-2K max resolution\n-expandable storage\n\nS9 con's:\n-previous gen CPU\n-Barely got the latest version of android\n-Will likely have little support \n-No portrait mode or smart lighting \n-Screen defaults to 1080p\n-smaller display\n-OS lags often\n-Poor speakers\n\nHonestly, there's not much between them, considering they're basically the same price, the only big thing that sticks out from the XR is the 820p display, which is basically just 720p. Which absolutely shouldn't matter on a technical level for most people, considering my internet can barely handle 1080p video streaming. The XZ premium and XZ2 premium both have 4k displays, yet no one complains when the s9+ only has a max of 2k, set to 1080p by default. While I love the larger resolutions, with the limitations of internet connections that aren't exceptional, and the fact that a phone display is smaller than a monitor, 820p isn't that bad. Especially considering that apart from the display, the XR is better than the s9 in almost every other way."""

They invest so heavily into marketing, (more than anyone else) that they've essentially been able to capitalize on the common ignorance of the general public with regards to technology.

They make the note and s series lokk like a piece of art as they are. I was excited for the XR as to see what apple could do with a less expensive phone but now theres no innovation left in them. If you cant make a good fucking phone with a 800 bucks budget then you should drown in a bucket. With marely 2014 specs yeah though a powerful processor but no point as the screen would not be able to radiate that power on it. I think apple should learn from oneplus how they crankup such high features in a wondering budget. I have a 5t and I'll never even trade it for the latest successors of iphones. I need power and dependence not fancy shit and I'll think most probably 99 % of consumers want the same. If I would havr been tim cook I would seriously worrying about my post 5 to 10 year plans as to what now we can do after doing the same shit over and over again. I'm never getting excited abiut apple event's as they barely have something new. The last innovative thing that they did was a full screen display and thats it. You are done while brands like samsung, oneplus and even mi are constantly innovating as of for future. I thought XR will be game changing in a country like india but if you have to pay 799 for a this much specked phone and even adding the tax and excise duties the shitty governments put on apple devices its a total fail in indian market."""

Does it have wide stereo speakers like the s models? \n\nAnd unlike the 8 last year, this gets reduced bezels from the 8, more battery than the plus, in a smaller package than the plus, gets portrait mode front and back, have a faster than X face id, cheaper than the 8 plus, with a 7nm a12, same smart HDR like the s model.
