Samsung flagship phone reviews are constantly rated lower than Apple or even Google Pixel phones. The Verge always uses their \""A\"" team of Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Vlad Slavov to cover Apple events and review Apple phones while they use their \""B\"" team to cover Samsung events or review their flagship phones. That fact alone tells you that the Verge doesn't consider Samsung events or flagship phones very important, or at least worthy enough to have their best staff cover it. Generally speaking, Samsung stories on the Verge are usually highly critical and written to portray Samsung in a negative light while their Apple stories are normally full of praise and written to show Apple in a favorable light. And if you don't believe me, just listen to their one of their podcast. Nilay and Dieter Bohn are constantly trashing Samsung. \n\nBut hey, that's perfectly fine!! Actually, I have no problem with any tech site giving Apple favorable treatment. As a matter of fact, if I were the editor in chief at the Verge, I certainly wouldn't wanna do anything to piss off Apple, would you?? Piss off Apple and it has some serious consequences. No more invitations to Apple events. No more advance review phones. No more soup for you! Since Apple Keynotes are the Super Bowl of tech events, it would be absolutely stupid from a business standpoint to do anything whatsoever that might be offensive to Apple. So, I certainly don't blame the Verge for being pro-Apple and anti-Samsung. Apple is their guaranteed meal ticket. The Verge should be applauded for knowing which side their bread is buttered on!!"""

Why was the colour temperature so high? Might have been better not zoomed in to 225%. Also I actually preferred the zoomed in shot on the iPhone versus the pixel which looked slightly more faded and grainy. It is really all about personal preference.

They are, as is the case with every new iPhone, aimed at people coming from OLDER iPhones (such as 7, 6s or even 5s/5). \n\nThe idea that Apple makes iPhones ONLY for those who bought last year's iPhone is INSANE. You don't buy an iPhone every year (!) unless you are a famous Youtuber or are filthy rich. \n\nMOST people that buy one use their iPhone for AT LEAST 2-3 years (some for '5' years, even) before upgrading. Unlike Android flagships, iPhones are traditionally extremely future-proof: the '5S', which released all the way back in *2013*, is STILL getting software updates & running smooth as butter in '2018'.\n\nSo.. The industry-first '7 nm processor', the '8-core ML neural engine', the crazy-powerful GPU & ALL the other super hardware upgrades that might seem 'overkill' today are actually there, IRONICALLY enough, so 'people WON'T need to buy a new iPhone for the next few years'..  \n\nReviewers always fail to take all that into account & end up judging the latest iPhone purely in relation to how it stacks up against its immediate predecessor: So they simply quote the '15%' jump in this and '30%' boost in that. They don't see the '300%' jump that someone coming from a 5S or 6 would experience. Shallow A....F.\n\nWhile long-time customers, aka the MAJORITY of iPhone buyers, understand Apple's long-term approach & ignore these reviews. \n\nWhich is precisely why iPhone sales are NEVER affected by reviews, however negative or even positive they might be. Cuz for the most part, they're 'unrelatable'."""

Your new iphone(refurb) is someone else\u2019s broken phone. They don\u2019t use apple parts and I have never had s good experience with insurance. I will say iPhone X is the best phone I ever used. Face ID works 99.9 percent of times. Idc of my rooms pitch black or have a hat on. And it opens apps. We all get caught up in oh the new one right? U throw case on I use apple silicone case. It has protected me every yr face drops and it doesn\u2019t make ur phone look like a block. Case is way better then u think. So, if u have iPhone 7 or even 8 yes upgrade is worth it.

They are, as is the case with every new iPhone, aimed at people coming from OLDER iPhones (such as 7, 6s or even 5s/5). \n\nThe idea that Apple makes iPhones ONLY for those who bought *last year's* iPhone is INSANE. You don't buy an iPhone *every year* (!) unless you are a famous Youtuber or are filthy rich. \n\nMOST people that buy one use their iPhone for AT LEAST 2-3 years (some for '5' years, even) before upgrading. Unlike Android flagships, iPhones are traditionally extremely future-proof: the '5S', which released all the way back in *2013*, is STILL getting software updates & running smooth as butter in '2018'.\n\nSo.. The industry-first '7 nm processor', the '8-core ML neural engine', the crazy-powerful GPU & ALL the other super hardware upgrades that might seem 'overkill' *today* are actually there, IRONICALLY enough, so 'people WON'T need to buy a new iPhone for the next few years'..  \n\nReviewers always fail to take all that into account & end up judging the latest iPhone *purely* in relation to how it stacks up against its immediate predecessor: So they simply quote the '15%' jump in this and '30%' boost in that. They don't see the '300%' jump that someone coming from a 5S or 6 would experience. Shallow AH.\n\nWhile long-time customers, aka the MAJORITY of iPhone buyers, understand Apple's long-term approach & ignore these reviews. \n\nWhich is *precisely* why iPhone sales are NEVER affected by reviews, however negative or even positive they might be. Cuz for the most part, they're 'unrelatable'."""

Unfortunately, not only because competition has pretty much caught up and surpassed them in some fields, but also because Apple is truly falling behind compared to themselves previously.

I\u2019m not sure why a lot of people expect the iPhone XS to be drastically different from the iPhone X when they are both of the same product line.

For example, when Honda releases an entirely new Honda Civic lineup [redesigned] the following model year is merely a \u201ctouched up\u201d version, hence the iPhone X & iPhone XS. This is how companies maximize ROI and remain profitable."""

I have loved this phone since but I have been waiting for an X plus version which is what the XS Max basically is. I will not be picking up this phone for a couple of reasons. The price tag is way too high for me so I will be waiting until hopefully next year when it comes down or they come out with a new phone with a significant amount of upgrades making the purchase actually worth it. The second reason is simply that I've only had this 8 plus for a year now and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it besides the shattered back of the phone (which is covered by my case anyway).

I asked myself a simple question.  Which phone would I want in my pocket in an emergency situation.  It takes me no time to blurt out, iPhone.  Of all the phones and all the products and all the tech companies out there, Apple is the one that I actually trust to deliver something that works well, the vast majority of the time.  Apple makes products that do something that no other products have done for me.  They exceed my expectation.  You might wonder, if I hold Apple with such high regard then why am I not using an iPhone and have never owned one.  The answer is simply that I don't like Apple's barebones approach to most of their products.  While the Note has comically garbage software in it like Bixby, the mess that preceeded Bixby (LOL), the Samsung Health app which is as comical as Bixby of course, and other stuff that kinda sorta works, it does have a lot of stuff in there that I actually want and use all the time.  And Samsung has those things, exclusively.  iPhone doesn't begin to try to make a mobile device to empower the consumer.  However.  The iPhone is more likely to save my life if I went, \""Cough, cough, \""hey Bixby (or Siri)....cough, cough....dial 911....\""  Bixby would probably go.....\""OK, navigating to Dunkin Donuts....you've reached level 1075 Bixby points\"".  Siri on the other hand would probably hear me coughing and go...\""I-hear-you-coughing....Should-I-Call-911?\""  I don't think that's an exaggeration.  That's the advice that Bixby gave me, twice, when I asked, what is the fastest car in the world.  The answer...Here's Dunkin Donuts on the map."""
